QUESTION: what is the average age of patients whose language is cape and primary disease is hyperglycemia?

TRUE: SELECT AVG ( DEMOGRAPHIC."AGE" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."LANGUAGE" = "CAPE" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS" = "HYPERGLYCEMIA"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the average age of patients whose language is 'cape' and primary disease is hyperglycemia. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The demographic table has age and language, and the diagnoses table has the disease information. Since the primary disease is hyperglycemia, I should check the DIAGNOSES table's SHORT_TITLE for an exact match. The user mentioned using SHORT_TITLE for exact terms. I need to join DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID or SUBJECT_ID. Wait, in the schema, both tables have HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. But in the data preview, DIAGNOSES entries have the same HADM_ID as DEMOGRAPHIC. So joining on HADM_ID makes sense here because each admission (HADM_ID) in DEMOGRAPHIC corresponds to diagnoses for that admission. Wait, but each patient (SUBJECT_ID) can have multiple HADM_IDs. However, the question is about the patient's primary disease. The DIAGNOSIS column in DEMOGRAPHIC might be the primary diagnosis. Wait, looking at the schema, DEMOGRAPHIC has a DIAGNOSIS column. So maybe the primary disease is in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. But the user mentioned "primary disease is hyperglycemia", which could be in DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE. Wait, the data_preview says for DIAGNOSES, when asked to use SHORT_TITLE to search and exact term. So the user's example used DIAGNOSES.ICD9_CODE, but here the question is about the disease name. So perhaps the primary disease is in DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE, and we need to find patients with that diagnosis. Wait, the user's example was "Find all patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951" and the SQL joined DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID, filtering DIAGNOSES.ICD9_CODE. But in this case, the question is about the primary disease being hyperglycemia. The DIAGNOSES table's SHORT_TITLE is where the disease name is stored. So we need to find patients with a diagnosis where SHORT_TITLE is 'hyperglycemia'. But the user's data_preview for DIAGNOSES shows entries like "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". So the SHORT_TITLE is the exact term. Therefore, the condition would be DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = 'hyperglycemia'. But wait, the primary disease might be the main diagnosis in the DEMOGRAPHIC table's DIAGNOSIS column. Let me check the schema again. The DEMOGRAPHIC table has a DIAGNOSIS column. For example, in the data preview, one entry has DIAGNOSIS as 'SEPSIS'. So perhaps the primary diagnosis is in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS, and other diagnoses are in DIAGNOSES. But the user's question says "primary disease is hyperglycemia", which might refer to the main diagnosis in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. However, the data_preview note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user refers to a disease name, we should use DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE. But the question mentions "primary disease", which might be in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the user's note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user mentions a disease name, like hyperglycemia, we should look in DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE. But the primary disease might be the main one in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. However, the example given in the data_preview for DIAGNOSES shows that the SHORT_TITLE is the exact term. So perhaps the user's question is looking for patients who have a diagnosis (any) of hyperglycemia, not necessarily the primary one. But the question specifies "primary disease", which might be in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. Let me check the schema again. In the DEMOGRAPHIC table, there's a DIAGNOSIS column. For example, in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS is 'SEPSIS' for one patient. So that's likely the primary diagnosis. Therefore, if the user is asking for primary disease being hyperglycemia, we should filter DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS = 'hyperglycemia'. However, the data_preview note says that for diagnoses, use SHORT_TITLE. But that note is under the DIAGNOSES table. So perhaps the primary diagnosis is in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS, and other diagnoses are in DIAGNOSES. So the user's question is about patients whose primary disease (DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS) is hyperglycemia and language is 'cape'. Wait, the user's question is: "average age of patients whose language is cape and primary disease is hyperglycemia". So two conditions: language is 'cape' (from DEMOGRAPHIC.LANGUAGE) and primary disease is hyperglycemia (from DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS). But in the data_preview, the DEMOGRAPHIC.LANGUAGE is empty for some entries. So the LANGUAGE column is in DEMOGRAPHIC. So the SQL would need to select from DEMOGRAPHIC where LANGUAGE = 'cape' and DIAGNOSIS = 'hyperglycemia', then compute the average age. Wait, but the example given in the job description shows joining with DIAGNOSES when the question is about a diagnosis. But in that example, the user asked for ICD9 code, which is in DIAGNOSES. However, in this case, if the primary disease is in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS, then we don't need to join with DIAGNOSES. But the user's question says "primary disease", which is likely the main diagnosis in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. So the SQL would be: SELECT AVG(DEMOGRAPHIC.AGE) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC.LANGUAGE = 'cape' AND DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS = 'hyperglycemia' But wait, in the data_preview, the DIAGNOSIS in DEMOGRAPHIC is 'SEPSIS', 'HEPATITIS B', etc. So if the primary disease is hyperglycemia, it's stored in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. Therefore, the correct approach is to filter DEMOGRAPHIC where DIAGNOSIS is 'hyperglycemia' and LANGUAGE is 'cape', then average the age. But the user's data_preview note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked" under the DIAGNOSES table. So if the user refers to a disease name, should we use DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE instead? But the question mentions "primary disease", which is in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. So perhaps the answer depends on whether hyperglycemia is the primary diagnosis (in DEMOGRAPHIC) or any diagnosis (in DIAGNOSES). The user's question specifies "primary disease", so it's the former. Therefore, the SQL would be selecting from DEMOGRAPHIC where DIAGNOSIS = 'hyperglycemia' and LANGUAGE = 'cape', then AVG(AGE). But wait, in the data_preview, the DEMOGRAPHIC.LANGUAGE is empty for some entries. So the condition is LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC.LANGUAGE) = 'cape'? Or is the value stored as lowercase? The example in the data_preview shows LANGUAGE as empty strings, but perhaps in the actual data, it's stored in uppercase. The user's instruction says to match lowercase using LOWER(), so perhaps we should use LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC.LANGUAGE) = 'cape'. Wait, the example given in the job description uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" without LOWER(), but that's a code. For text fields, the user's example in the data_preview note says to use SHORT_TITLE and exact term. But for the LANGUAGE field, which is a text field, the user might have values in any case, so to match 'cape' case-insensitively, we should use LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC.LANGUAGE) = 'cape'. Similarly, for DIAGNOSIS in DEMOGRAPHIC, if the value is stored in uppercase (e.g., 'SEPSIS'), then to match 'hyperglycemia', we need to use LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS) = 'hyperglycemia'. But the user's note says for DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE, use exact term. However, the DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS is a free-text field, so perhaps the exact match is case-sensitive. But the user's question uses lowercase 'hyperglycemia', so to ensure a match, we should use LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS) = 'hyperglycemia'. But wait, the example in the job description didn't use LOWER() for the ICD9_CODE, which is a string but treated as exact. However, for text fields like LANGUAGE and DIAGNOSIS, which might have varying cases, using LOWER() would be safer. The user's

QUESTION: what is the minimum days of hospital stay of patients whose admission type is urgent?

TRUE: SELECT MIN ( DEMOGRAPHIC."DAYS_STAY" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."ADMISSION_TYPE" = "URGENT"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: and return only the query. Also, when matching strings, use LOWER(). Wait, the example didn't use LOWER(), but the instruction says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()". Wait, the example has DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", but ICD9_CODE is a TEXT field, and the value is "9951" as a string. But the instruction says to use LOWER() when matching strings. Wait, the example might not follow that because it's an exact code. Hmm, the instruction says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". Wait, the example given in the job description uses "ICD9_CODE" = "9951", but perhaps that's because the code is a number stored as text. The user instruction says to use LOWER() when matching strings. So for ADMISSION_TYPE, which is a text field, if the value is stored as 'URGENT' in uppercase, and the user says "urgent", we should use LOWER(ADMISSION_TYPE) = 'urgent' to make it case-insensitive. Wait, but in the data preview, the ADMISSION_TYPE is "EMERGENCY", which is uppercase. So if the user's question is about "urgent", perhaps the actual value in the database is 'URGENT' (uppercase), so the correct comparison would be ADMISSION_TYPE = 'URGENT'. But the user wrote "admission type is urgent" in lowercase. To make sure it's case-insensitive, we should use LOWER(ADMISSION_TYPE) = 'urgent'. However, the example provided in the job description didn't use LOWER() for the ICD9_CODE, which is a string. So maybe the instruction is conflicting. Let me check the job description again. The job description says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". So the example might have been an exception because the code is numeric. So for text fields like ADMISSION_TYPE, we should use LOWER() to make the match case-insensitive. Therefore, the WHERE clause should be WHERE LOWER(demographic.ADMISSION_TYPE) = 'urgent'. But wait, in the data preview, the ADMISSION_TYPE is "EMERGENCY", which is uppercase. So if the value is stored in uppercase, then using LOWER(ADMISSION_TYPE) = 'urgent' would convert "EMERGENCY" to lowercase, which is 'emergency', not matching 'urgent'. Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps the user's question refers to 'urgent' as the admission type, but in the database, it's stored as 'URGENT'. Therefore, the correct comparison is ADMISSION_TYPE = 'URGENT' without using LOWER(). But the user wrote "urgent" in lowercase. So maybe the actual value is 'URGENT', and the user's input is case-insensitive, so we need to match regardless of case. Therefore, using LOWER(ADMISSION_TYPE) = 'urgent' would correctly match if the stored value is 'URGENT' (since LOWER('URGENT') is 'urgent'). But in the data preview, the ADMISSION_TYPE is "EMERGENCY", which is uppercase, so perhaps all values are stored in uppercase. Therefore, the correct approach is to compare against 'URGENT' in uppercase. But the user's question uses lowercase. So to make it case-insensitive, we should use LOWER(ADMISSION_TYPE) = 'urgent'. Alternatively, maybe the ADMISSION_TYPE can have different cases, but in the data preview, it's all uppercase. So perhaps the correct value is 'URGENT' in uppercase, and the user's query is using 'urgent' in lowercase. Therefore, to match it correctly, we should use LOWER(ADMISSION_TYPE) = 'urgent'. So the SQL query would be: SELECT MIN(demographic.DAYS_STAY) FROM demographic WHERE LOWER(demographic.ADMISSION_TYPE) = 'urgent' But wait, the job description says to wrap column names in quotes and prefix with table names. For example, in the example, they used DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID". So perhaps the correct way is to use quotes around column names and table names. Wait, in SQLite, if the column names have spaces or are reserved words, they need to be quoted. But in the schema, the columns are defined with quotes, like "SUBJECT_ID". So perhaps the correct way is to always use double quotes around column names and table names, even if they don't have spaces. For example, "demographic"."ADMISSION_TYPE". But looking at the example provided in the job description, the output was: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" Wait, in the WHERE clause, they used DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", but "9951" is in double quotes, which in SQL should be single quotes. But maybe in their specific setup, it's allowed. However, the correct SQL syntax requires string literals to be in single quotes. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow that format. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the correct would be '9951' in single quotes. But according to the job description, we should return the SQL with the correct syntax. So for the current question, the correct SQL would be: SELECT MIN("demographic"."DAYS_STAY") FROM "demographic" WHERE LOWER("demographic"."ADMISSION_TYPE") = 'urgent' But wait, the job description says: "When selecting or counting columns always prefix them with TABLE_NAME and wrap in quotes." So for the MIN function, we need to prefix the column with the table name and wrap in quotes. So "demographic"."DAYS_STAY". Also, the table name in the FROM clause should be in quotes? The example uses FROM DEMOGRAPHIC, which is the table name without quotes. But in the schema, the table is created as "demographic". In SQLite, table names are case-insensitive but stored as entered. If the table is created with quotes, then perhaps it's necessary to use quotes. But the example uses DEMOGRAPHIC without quotes. Hmm, perhaps the table names are case-insensitive, and the quotes are only for column names. So maybe the correct approach is to use the table name without quotes in the FROM clause, but columns with quotes and prefixed with the table name. So the final query would be: SELECT MIN("demographic"."DAYS_STAY") FROM demographic WHERE LOWER("demographic"."ADMISSION_TYPE") = 'urgent' But wait, the user's question is about "admission type is urgent". If the actual value in the database is 'URGENT', then using LOWER would convert it to 'urgent', matching

QUESTION: Get the list of white-russian patients with a neb route of drug administration.

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PRESCRIPTIONS on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PRESCRIPTIONS.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" = "WHITE - RUSSIAN" AND PRESCRIPTIONS."ROUTE" = "NEB"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants a list of White-Russian patients who have a 'neb' route of drug administration. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The patient's ethnicity is in the DEMOGRAPHIC table, and the route of drug administration is in the PRESCRIPTIONS table. So, I'll need to join these two tables. The DEMOGRAPHIC table has the ETHNICITY column. The user mentioned "White-Russian" patients. Looking at the data preview, the ETHNICITY examples include "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" and "UNKNOWN/NOT SPECIFIED". So, the exact value might be "WHITE RUSSIAN" or similar. But since the user wrote "white-russian", maybe it's stored as "WHITE-RUSSIAN" or another variation. However, the exact match is needed. The user probably expects ETHNICITY = 'WHITE RUSSIAN' or similar. Wait, in the data_preview, the example for ETHNICITY is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" and "UNKNOWN/NOT SPECIFIED". So maybe the exact value is "WHITE RUSSIAN" or "WHITE-RUSSIAN". The user wrote "white-russian", but in the database, it's probably stored in uppercase. So, using LOWER(ETHNICITY) = 'white russian' or 'white-russian'? The user's input says "white-russian", but maybe the data uses a hyphen or space. To be safe, maybe use LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") LIKE '%white%russian%'? But the user said "exact term as asked" in the schema notes. Wait, the schema says for diagnoses, use SHORT_TITLE exact term. But for demographic, maybe it's exact. Let me check the data_preview. In the DEMOGRAPHIC example, one row has ETHNICITY as "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" and another as "UNKNOWN/NOT SPECIFIED". So the exact value is important. The user wrote "white-russian", but maybe the actual value is "WHITE RUSSIAN" or "WHITE-RUSSIAN". To match exactly, perhaps the ETHNICITY is stored as "WHITE RUSSIAN", so using LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") = 'white russian'? Or maybe the hyphen is present. The user's input uses a hyphen, but the data might not. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the ethnicity is stored as 'RUSSIAN' under ETHNICITY, but the user says 'white-russian'. This is a bit ambiguous. But given the user's instruction, perhaps we should use an exact match on the ETHNICITY column. However, since the user wrote "white-russian", maybe the correct approach is to use LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") = 'white-russian'. But without knowing the exact value in the database, it's tricky. The example data doesn't have a 'white-russian' entry, but the user is asking for it, so perhaps the data does have that value. So, proceed with LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") = 'white-russian'. Next, the route in PRESCRIPTIONS is 'neb'. The ROUTE column in PRESCRIPTIONS has values like 'IM', 'PO', 'PR' in the data preview. The user is asking for 'neb', which might be an abbreviation for nebulizer. So, looking for PRESCRIPTIONS."ROUTE" = 'NEB' or 'neb'? The data preview shows 'IM', 'PO', etc., in uppercase. So the ROUTE is probably stored in uppercase. But the user wrote 'neb' in lowercase. So, to match, we should use LOWER(PRESCRIPTIONS."ROUTE") = 'neb' to ensure case insensitivity. Now, joining DEMOGRAPHIC and PRESCRIPTIONS on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Wait, both tables have SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. So the join should be on both columns to ensure that the prescription is linked to the correct hospital admission for the patient. So, DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID = PRESCRIPTIONS.SUBJECT_ID AND DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PRESCRIPTIONS.HADM_ID. The question asks for the list of patients, so we need to select DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" to avoid duplicates if a patient has multiple prescriptions with 'neb' route. Putting it all together: SELECT DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PRESCRIPTIONS ON DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" = PRESCRIPTIONS."SUBJECT_ID" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."HADM_ID" = PRESCRIPTIONS."HADM_ID" WHERE LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") = 'white-russian' AND LOWER(PRESCRIPTIONS."ROUTE") = 'neb'; Wait, but the user's example uses quotes around the value, like "9951". In SQLite, string literals should be in single quotes. So, should use 'white-russian' and 'neb' with single quotes. Also, the example uses LOWER() on the column and the value. For example, in the example, DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" but that's a number. Wait, in the example, the ICD9_CODE is a string, as per the schema (TEXT). So the example uses double quotes around "9951", but in SQLite, string literals should be in single quotes. Wait, the example output shows: WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" But in SQLite, "9951" would be treated as a string if the column is TEXT, but using double quotes is incorrect. Wait, in SQLite, double quotes are used for identifiers, single quotes for string literals. So the example might have a mistake. But the user provided that example, so perhaps they expect us to follow that format. However, in reality, the correct way is to use single quotes for string literals. So, in the current query, for the WHERE clauses, we should use: LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") = 'white-russian' AND LOWER(PRESCRIPTIONS."ROUTE") = 'neb' But the example uses double quotes. Hmm. The user's instruction says to assume SQLite and be careful with functions. So, correct SQLite syntax would require single quotes for string literals. Therefore, the correct conditions are with single quotes. So the final query should have 'white-russian' and 'neb' in single quotes. Also, the user wants the list of patients, which is their SUBJECT_ID from DEMOGRAPHIC. Since each patient can have multiple HADM_IDs, but we're joining on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID, but the DISTINCT on SUBJECT_ID should suffice to list each patient once if they have at least one prescription with 'neb' route and the correct ethnicity. Wait, but if a patient has multiple HADM_IDs where in one HADM_ID they have a 'neb' route, but in another they don't, the DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID would still include them. But the question is to find patients (regardless of admission) who have at least one prescription with 'neb' route. So joining on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID might be too restrictive. Wait, no: the PRESCRIPTIONS table has HADM_ID, which is the hospital admission ID. So each prescription is tied to a specific admission. Therefore, to find patients who have any prescription with 'neb' route in any of their admissions, we need to join on SUBJECT_ID only? Or on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID? Wait, the DEMOGRAPHIC table has one row per HADM_ID, since each HADM_ID is a hospital admission for a SUBJECT_ID. So a patient can have multiple HADM_IDs. But the ETHNICITY is per admission? Or is it per patient? Wait, looking at the schema for DEMOGRAPHIC: it has SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. But ethnicity is a patient attribute, not per admission. So perhaps the DEMOGRAPHIC table has one row per admission, but some attributes like ETHNICITY are the same for all admissions of the same patient. But that's not necessarily the case. However, in reality, a patient's ethnicity doesn't change between admissions. But in the data_preview, for example, SUBJECT_ID 10006 has HADM_ID 142345 and ETHNICITY "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". If that patient has another admission, their ETHNICITY would presumably be the same. But the schema allows for different values. However, the user's question is about the patient's ethnicity, so we need to ensure that for any admission where they have a 'neb' prescription, their ethnicity is White-Russian. But perhaps the correct approach is to join on SUBJECT_ID only, assuming that ethnicity is consistent across all admissions for a patient. But the schema doesn't specify that. So, to be accurate, we need to join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID to ensure that the ethnicity recorded for that specific admission is White-Russian, and that the prescription for 'neb' route is in the same admission.

QUESTION: how many asian patients had liver transplant as their primary disease?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" = "ASIAN" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS" = "LIVER TRANSPLANT"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user is asking for the number of Asian patients who had a liver transplant as their primary disease. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The demographic table has ethnicity information, so that's where we'll check for Asian patients. The primary disease is probably in the demographic table under the DIAGNOSIS column, as that's the admission diagnosis. Wait, the question mentions "liver transplant as their primary disease." But liver transplant is a procedure, not a diagnosis. Hmm, maybe the user is confused. Alternatively, maybe they consider the primary diagnosis to be related to a liver transplant. But in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS field in demographic has entries like "SEPSIS" or "HEPATITIS B". The procedures table has entries like "Packed cell transfusion" or "Arterial catheterization". So a liver transplant would likely be a procedure, not a diagnosis. But the user specified "primary disease", which might refer to the DIAGNOSIS column in demographic. Wait, the user might be mixing terms. Let me check the schema again. The demographic table has a DIAGNOSIS column, which is the admission diagnosis. The diagnoses table contains all diagnoses for a patient. But the question says "primary disease", which might refer to the main diagnosis upon admission, which is in the demographic table. Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is the first one listed in the diagnoses table. But the user's example shows using the diagnoses table for conditions like cancer. But the question is about "liver transplant" as the primary disease. Liver transplant is a procedure, not a diagnosis. So perhaps the user made a mistake, and actually means a diagnosis that required a liver transplant, or the primary diagnosis is a condition that leads to a liver transplant. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the procedure being the primary reason. But given the data, the procedures table has SHORT_TITLE like "Packed cell transfusion". If "liver transplant" is a procedure, then we need to check the procedures table for that. But the question says "primary disease", which is a diagnosis. This is a bit conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering "liver transplant" as the primary diagnosis, which might be a mistake. But according to the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is things like "SEPSIS". So perhaps the primary disease is the DIAGNOSIS column in demographic. Wait, the user's question is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read it: "how many asian patients had liver transplant as their primary disease?" So they consider liver transplant as the primary disease. But in medical terms, a transplant is a procedure, not a disease. The primary disease would be the condition that led to the transplant, like liver failure. But the user might not know that and is using "liver transplant" as the diagnosis. So perhaps we need to look in the demographic's DIAGNOSIS column for "liver transplant", even though that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe the diagnoses table has a SHORT_TITLE related to liver transplant. Looking at the data preview for diagnoses, the SHORT_TITLEs are things like "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". So maybe there's a diagnosis code that corresponds to liver transplant, but that's unlikely. More likely, the liver transplant is a procedure. But the user is asking for primary disease, which is in the demographic's DIAGNOSIS. So perhaps the answer requires checking the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS for 'liver transplant' and the ethnicity as Asian. But in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B", etc. So if the user's question is based on that, maybe the DIAGNOSIS column has 'liver transplant' as a value. But that's not typical. Alternatively, maybe the primary disease is the main diagnosis from the diagnoses table, which would be the first entry for that HADM_ID. But the example given in the data_preview shows multiple diagnoses per HADM_ID. Alternatively, perhaps the user is conflating the procedure (liver transplant) with the diagnosis. So the correct approach would be to find patients who have a procedure of liver transplant and are Asian. But the question states "as their primary disease", which is confusing. Given the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to convert their question as is, perhaps we should look for patients where their primary diagnosis (demographic.DIAGNOSIS) is 'liver transplant' and ethnicity is Asian. But in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is 'SEPSIS', 'HEPATITIS B', etc. So 'liver transplant' is not present there. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake, and the actual intent is to find patients who underwent a liver transplant procedure and are Asian. Alternatively, maybe the primary disease is in the diagnoses table, and the primary is indicated by being the first entry or a specific code. But the user hasn't specified that. Given the user's question as stated, perhaps the correct approach is to join demographic and diagnoses tables, filtering for ethnicity 'ASIAN' and diagnosis SHORT_TITLE 'liver transplant'. But in the data preview, the diagnoses' SHORT_TITLEs are things like 'Hyposmolality', so maybe the user is referring to a diagnosis that necessitates a transplant. Alternatively, perhaps the liver transplant is a procedure, so we need to join demographic with procedures where the procedure is 'liver transplant' and the ethnicity is Asian. But the question says "primary disease", which is a diagnosis. So this is conflicting. Given the ambiguity, but following the user's example where they used the diagnoses table for a diagnosis code, perhaps the user intended to look for a diagnosis related to liver transplant. But if that's not present, maybe the procedure is the way to go. Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken, and the correct approach is to look for patients with a procedure of liver transplant and Asian ethnicity. But the question specifically says "primary disease", which is a diagnosis. So perhaps the answer should involve the demographic's DIAGNOSIS column. Wait, the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS is the admission diagnosis, which is the primary one. So if the user is asking for patients whose primary diagnosis (on admission) is liver transplant, then we check demographic.DIAGNOSIS = 'liver transplant' and demographic.ETHNICITY = 'Asian'. But in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS values are like 'SEPSIS', so maybe 'liver transplant' isn't present. But the user's question is hypothetical. So the SQL would select count(distinct demographic.subject_id) from demographic where demographic.ethnicity is 'ASIAN' and demographic.diagnosis is 'liver transplant'. But wait, the user might have meant that the primary disease is a liver condition that required a transplant, but that's more complex. Alternatively, maybe the primary disease is in the diagnoses table, and the SHORT_TITLE is 'liver transplant'. But in the data preview, the diagnoses have SHORT_TITLEs like 'Hyposmolality', so perhaps the user is using 'liver transplant' as a diagnosis, which is incorrect. Given the user's question as stated, the best approach is to take 'liver transplant' as the primary diagnosis (demographic.DIAGNOSIS) and filter for Asian ethnicity. But in the schema, the demographic.ETHNICITY field is a text, so we need to match 'ASIAN' exactly. So the SQL would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID") FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" = 'ASIAN' AND DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS" = 'liver transplant'; But wait, the user's example uses the diagnoses table for the ICD9 code. Maybe the primary disease is in the diagnoses table, and the primary is the one with a certain ICD9 code. But the user didn't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps the primary disease is the first diagnosis in the diagnoses table for a patient. But without a way to determine which is primary, that's uncertain. Given the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to use exact terms as asked, and the example where they used the diagnoses table for a diagnosis code, perhaps the user intended to use the diagnoses table's SHORT_TITLE. Wait, the user's example had: User: Find all patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951. The output joined demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID and checked ICD9_CODE. So in this case, if the user is asking for patients diagnosed with 'liver transplant', which is a SHORT_TITLE in diagnoses, then the SQL would join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID, filter where diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE = 'liver transplant' and demographic.ETHNICITY = 'ASIAN'. But 'liver transplant' is a procedure, not a diagnosis. So perhaps the user made a mistake, and the correct approach is to use the procedures table. But the question says "primary disease", which is a diagnosis. So this is conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to ask for patients who had a liver transplant procedure and are Asian, regardless of diagnosis. In that case, the SQL would join demographic and procedures on HADM_ID, filter where procedures.SHORT_TITLE = 'liver transplant' and demographic.ETHNICITY = 'ASIAN'. But the data preview for procedures has SHORT_TITLE like

QUESTION: how many white patients had the primary disease bradycardia?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" = "WHITE" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS" = "BRADYCARDIA"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user is asking for the number of white patients who had the primary disease bradycardia. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The demographic data is in the DEMOGRAPHIC table, and the primary diagnosis is in the DIAGNOSES table. Since the question mentions "primary disease," I should check if there's a specific column indicating primary diagnoses, but looking at the schema, the DIAGNOSES table doesn't have a primary flag. However, the DEMOGRAPHIC table has a DIAGNOSIS column which might be the primary diagnosis upon admission. The user might be referring to that. So, the primary diagnosis is in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. The ethnicity is in DEMOGRAPHIC.ETHNICITY. The question is about "white patients," so I need to filter where ETHNICITY is 'WHITE'. For bradycardia, I need to check if DIAGNOSIS in DEMOGRAPHIC matches 'bradycardia'. But wait, sometimes diagnoses can be in the DIAGNOSES table with ICD9 codes. However, the user specified "primary disease," which is likely the DIAGNOSIS column in DEMOGRAPHIC. Wait, looking at the data preview for DEMOGRAPHIC, the DIAGNOSIS column has entries like 'SEPSIS' and 'HEPATITIS B'. So if the primary diagnosis is there, then we can directly filter on that. The user might be using "bradycardia" as the diagnosis name, so we need to match DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS to 'bradycardia' and ETHNICITY to 'WHITE'. But wait, in the DIAGNOSES table, there's a SHORT_TITLE which might have 'Bradycardia' as a diagnosis. However, the user mentioned "primary disease," which might be the main diagnosis in DEMOGRAPHIC. Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is the first entry in DIAGNOSES. But the schema doesn't indicate a primary flag. The user's question is a bit ambiguous here. The user's instruction says: When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked. Wait, in the data_preview section, it says for DIAGNOSES: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked." So if the question is about a diagnosis, we should use the DIAGNOSES table and match SHORT_TITLE exactly. But the user mentioned "primary disease," which might still refer to the DIAGNOSIS column in DEMOGRAPHIC. Hmm. Wait, the user's example query was about ICD9 code, but here the question is about the disease name. The data_preview note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked." So if the user mentions a diagnosis by name, like "bradycardia," we should look in DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE for an exact match. But the primary disease might be in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. The example given in the data_preview for DEMOGRAPHIC shows DIAGNOSIS as 'SEPSIS', which is a general term, while DIAGNOSES has more specific codes and titles. The user's question is: "how many white patients had the primary disease bradycardia?" The term "primary disease" might refer to the main diagnosis listed in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. Alternatively, it could mean the primary diagnosis in the DIAGNOSES table, but that table doesn't have a primary flag. Since the example in the data_preview for DIAGNOSES includes "Congestive heart failure, unspecified" as a LONG_TITLE, but the SHORT_TITLE is "CHF NOS". If the user is asking for patients whose primary disease is bradycardia, and "bradycardia" is the SHORT_TITLE in DIAGNOSES, then we need to join DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID, filter where DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = 'Bradycardia' and DEMOGRAPHIC.ETHNICITY = 'WHITE'. But wait, the exact term is important. The note says to use SHORT_TITLE and search by exact term as asked. The user wrote "bradycardia" in lowercase, but the SHORT_TITLE in the data is in uppercase, like "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". So maybe we need to use LOWER(DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE) = 'bradycardia' to match case-insensitively. But the instruction says to match exact term as asked. Wait, the data_preview note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked." So if the user says "bradycardia", we should look for exact match in SHORT_TITLE, which might be case-sensitive. But in the data preview, the SHORT_TITLEs are in uppercase. So perhaps the user's input needs to be matched exactly, but the SHORT_TITLE is stored in uppercase. So if the user says "bradycardia", it's lowercase, but the data is uppercase, so we need to use LOWER(DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE) = LOWER('bradycardia') to make it case-insensitive. Alternatively, maybe the SHORT_TITLE is stored as 'Bradycardia' with proper case, and the user's input is lowercase. To ensure a match, using LOWER() on both sides would help. But according to the instructions, when matching strings, use LOWER(). The example given in the job description uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", which is a number, but for strings, the example might be using LOWER(). For instance, if the user had asked for a diagnosis name, the model would use LOWER(SHORT_TITLE) = 'bradycardia'. But the data_preview note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked." So if the user says "bradycardia", we should search for SHORT_TITLE exactly as 'bradycardia', but in the data, it's stored in uppercase. So perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER(SHORT_TITLE) = 'bradycardia' to make it case-insensitive. However, the exact instruction is to "search by exact term as asked", which might imply that the user's input is taken literally. But if the data stores it in uppercase, then an exact match would require the term to be in uppercase. But the user wrote "bradycardia" in lowercase. This is a problem. So perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER(SHORT_TITLE) = LOWER('bradycardia') to ensure case insensitivity. Alternatively, maybe the SHORT_TITLE is stored in uppercase, and the user's term is lowercase, so we need to match case-insensitively. Therefore, the WHERE clause should have LOWER(DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE) = 'bradycardia'. Additionally, the primary disease might refer to the main diagnosis in the DEMOGRAPHIC table's DIAGNOSIS column. But the user's question is a bit ambiguous. However, given the data_preview note, when asked about diagnoses, we should use the DIAGNOSES table and SHORT_TITLE. So perhaps the user's mention of "primary disease" is redundant, and they just want patients diagnosed with bradycardia, regardless of whether it's primary or not. But if "primary" refers to the main diagnosis in DEMOGRAPHIC, then we need to check both DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS and DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE. Wait, the DEMOGRAPHIC table's DIAGNOSIS column is the primary diagnosis upon admission. So if the user is asking for the primary disease being bradycardia, we should check DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS = 'bradycardia'. However, in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS entries are like 'SEPSIS' and 'HEPATITIS B'. So if 'bradycardia' is a possible value there, then filtering on DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS would be correct. But if the DIAGNOSES table contains all diagnoses, including primary and secondary, then perhaps the primary is indicated in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. This is a bit confusing. The user's question is about "primary disease", which likely refers to the main diagnosis listed in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. So the correct approach would be to filter DEMOGRAPHIC where DIAGNOSIS = 'bradycardia' and ETHNICITY = 'WHITE', then count the distinct SUBJECT_ID. But wait, the example given in the job description uses a join between DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES when the question is about a diagnosis. For example, the user asked for patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951, and the SQL joins DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES. So perhaps even for primary diseases, the DIAGNOSES table is used, and the primary is determined by some other means, but the schema doesn't indicate that. Alternatively, the primary diagnosis is the one in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. Given the ambiguity, but following the example, which uses DIAGNOSES for the diagnosis code, perhaps the user's mention of "primary disease" is not a technical term here, and they just want patients with bradycardia in their diagnoses.

QUESTION: specify the total number of patients who had urgent admission due to venous catheterization for renal dialysis

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PROCEDURES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PROCEDURES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."ADMISSION_TYPE" = "URGENT" AND PROCEDURES."LONG_TITLE" = "Venous catheterization for renal dialysis"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the total number of patients who had urgent admission due to venous catheterization for renal dialysis. First, I need to break down the question. "Urgent admission" probably refers to the ADMISSION_TYPE in the demographic table. The example data shows "EMERGENCY" as an admission type, so maybe "URGENT" is another type. I should check if the demographic table has an ADMISSION_TYPE column. Yes, it does. So the condition here would be WHERE demographic."ADMISSION_TYPE" = 'URGENT'. Wait, the example data shows "EMERGENCY" but the user says "urgent". Maybe the actual value is 'URGENT'? I'll go with that. Next, "venous catheterization for renal dialysis" sounds like a procedure. The procedures table has SHORT_TITLE and LONG_TITLE. The user mentioned to use SHORT_TITLE for exact matches. So I need to look for entries in procedures where SHORT_TITLE is 'Venous catheterization for renal dialysis'. Let me check the data preview. In the procedures table, there's a SHORT_TITLE like "Cont inv mec ven <96 hrs", but not exactly the one mentioned. However, the user's instruction says to use exact term as asked. So even if the data might have a different term, the query should use the exact phrase provided by the user. So the condition would be procedures."SHORT_TITLE" = 'venous catheterization for renal dialysis'. Wait, but the example in the data preview uses uppercase, like "Packed cell transfusion". Should I use LOWER()? The user's note says when matching strings, use LOWER(). But in the example given earlier, the output used DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" without lower. Wait, the job description says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". Wait, the example given in the job description has WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" but that's a code, not a string. The note says to use LOWER() when matching strings. So perhaps for the SHORT_TITLE, we should do LOWER(procedures."SHORT_TITLE") = 'venous catheterization for renal dialysis'? But the user's instruction says to use exact term as asked. Hmm, conflicting info. Let me check the job description again. The user wrote: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So exact term, case-sensitive? Or should it be lowercased? The example in the data_preview for diagnoses uses exact codes. For example, "ICD9_CODE" = "2761". But for text fields like SHORT_TITLE, the user says to use exact term as asked. So if the user says "venous catheterization for renal dialysis", the query should match exactly that string in SHORT_TITLE. But maybe the data has it in a different case. For example, in the procedures data preview, the SHORT_TITLE is "Packed cell transfusion" with capital letters. So if the user's term is lowercase, it might not match. Therefore, to make it case-insensitive, we should use LOWER() on both sides. But the job description says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". So the correct approach is to use LOWER(procedures."SHORT_TITLE") = LOWER('venous catheterization for renal dialysis'). But the user's instruction says to use exact term as asked. Wait, the note in the schema for diagnoses says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So perhaps for diagnoses, it's exact, but for procedures, maybe the same applies. But the job description example uses exact match without lower. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the example given in the job description. The example user query is "Find all patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951", and the output is WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". So no LOWER() there because it's a code. For text fields like SHORT_TITLE, the user might have varying cases. So to be safe, perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER() on both sides. But the user's instruction says to use exact term as asked. Wait, the note in the schema for diagnoses says: "use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user provides the exact term, we should match it exactly. But in reality, the data might have variations in case. For example, if the SHORT_TITLE is "Venous Catheterization for Renal Dialysis" with capital letters, and the user's query is in lowercase, the exact match would fail. Therefore, to make it case-insensitive, we should use LOWER. But according to the user's note, should we match exactly as asked? The note says: "use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user writes 'venous catheterization for renal dialysis' in lowercase, the query should look for that exact string. But in the data, it might be stored in title case. Therefore, to ensure a match, we should use LOWER on both sides. However, the example given in the job description for diagnoses didn't use LOWER, but that was for an ICD9 code. So perhaps for text fields, we need to use LOWER. Let me check the job description's example again. The example output uses WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", which is a code, not text. So for text fields like SHORT_TITLE, the correct approach would be to use LOWER. But the user's note says to search by exact term as asked. This is conflicting. Let me re-read the user's instructions. In the schema section, under diagnoses, it says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So for diagnoses, exact term. But for procedures, the same might apply. So if the user's question is "venous catheterization for renal dialysis", the query should look for that exact string in SHORT_TITLE. However, in the data preview for procedures, the SHORT_TITLE entries are in title case, like "Packed cell transfusion". So if the data has "Venous Catheterization for Renal Dialysis" and the user's term is lowercase, the exact match would fail. Therefore, to make it case-insensitive, we should use LOWER. But the user's instruction says to search by exact term. Hmm. Maybe the correct approach here is to use LOWER(procedures."SHORT_TITLE") = 'venous catheterization for renal dialysis' but that would require the input to be lowercase. Alternatively, perhaps the SHORT_TITLE in the database is stored in uppercase, and the user's term is in lowercase. To handle case insensitivity, we should use LOWER on both sides. But according to the user's note, we should search by exact term. This is a bit confusing. Let me proceed with using LOWER to make it case-insensitive, as per the job description's general instruction: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()". So, the conditions would be: demographic."ADMISSION_TYPE" = 'URGENT' (assuming that's the value for urgent admissions) AND procedures."SHORT_TITLE" = 'venous catheterization for renal dialysis' (but with LOWER) Wait, but the user's note says to use exact term as asked, so perhaps the correct approach is to match the exact string, but the data might have it in a different case. Therefore, to ensure a match, use LOWER(procedures."SHORT_TITLE") = LOWER('venous catheterization for renal dialysis'). But the job description's example didn't do that for ICD9_CODE, which is a code. So perhaps for text fields, we need to use LOWER. So, the WHERE clause would be: WHERE demographic."ADMISSION_TYPE" = 'URGENT' AND LOWER(procedures."SHORT_TITLE") = LOWER('venous catheterization for renal dialysis') But wait, the user's question says "venous catheterization for renal dialysis". The exact term. So if the data has it in a different case, like "Venous Catheterization for Renal Dialysis", then using LOWER would match. Otherwise, an exact match would fail. Given that the user's instruction says to use exact term as asked, but the data may have varying cases, it's safer to use LOWER to make the match case-insensitive. Now, joining the tables. The demographic and procedures tables are connected by HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. Wait, in the demographic table, both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID are present. The procedures table also has SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. So to join them, we can use both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID, but perhaps HADM_ID is sufficient. Wait, each HADM_ID in demographic is unique per admission, and procedures are per admission as well. So joining on HADM_ID would link the procedures to the admission. So the join would be: FROM demographic INNER JOIN procedures ON demographic.HADM_ID = procedures.HADM_ID But wait, in the demographic table, HADM_ID is the hospital admission ID. Each row in demographic represents a patient's admission. So each HADM_ID is unique in demographic. Procedures are per admission, so each procedure is linked to an H

QUESTION: find me the number of unmarried patients who have 4523 procedure icd9 code.

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PROCEDURES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PROCEDURES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" = "SINGLE" AND PROCEDURES."ICD9_CODE" = "4523"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the number of unmarried patients who had a procedure with ICD9 code 4523. First, I need to identify the tables involved. The "procedures" table has the ICD9 codes for procedures, and "demographic" has marital status. Since the question is about patients, I should join these tables on HADM_ID or SUBJECT_ID. Wait, looking at the schema, both tables have SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. But procedures are per admission, so joining on HADM_ID might be more accurate. However, to ensure we get the correct patients, maybe joining on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID? Or perhaps just SUBJECT_ID since each patient can have multiple admissions. Hmm, but procedures are tied to a specific admission (HADM_ID). However, the demographic table has one row per HADM_ID as well. So joining on HADM_ID makes sense here. Wait, the demographic table has HADM_ID as a foreign key, so each row represents a patient's admission details. So each HADM_ID in demographic corresponds to an admission. The procedures table also has HADM_ID, so joining on HADM_ID would link the procedures to the correct admission. Therefore, the correct approach is to join DEMOGRAPHIC and PROCEDURES on HADM_ID. Next, the marital status. The demographic table has MARITAL_STATUS. The user says "unmarried", which could mean different statuses like SINGLE, SEPARATED, etc. But the example data shows "SINGLE" and "SEPARATED" as possible values. The user might consider "unmarried" as any status that's not MARRIED. However, the exact value in the data might vary. Wait, in the data preview, the first entry has MARITAL_STATUS as "SEPARATED", the second as "SINGLE", and the third as empty. So the question is, how is "unmarried" represented? The user might mean patients where MARITAL_STATUS is not 'MARRIED'. But we need to check if the data uses specific terms. For example, if the possible values are 'SINGLE', 'MARRIED', 'DIVORCED', 'WIDOWED', etc., then "unmarried" would include all except 'MARRIED'. However, the exact condition depends on the data. But the user's question says "unmarried", so perhaps we should filter where MARITAL_STATUS is 'SINGLE' or other non-married statuses. But without knowing all possible values, it's safer to use MARITAL_STATUS != 'MARRIED'. However, in the data preview, one entry has MARITAL_STATUS as "SEPARATED", another as "SINGLE", and another as empty. So maybe the condition is WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" != 'MARRIED' OR DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" IS NULL? Wait, but in the data preview, the third patient has an empty string for MARITAL_STATUS. Wait, looking at the schema, MARITAL_STATUS is TEXT. In the data preview, the third row has "" for MARITAL_STATUS. So perhaps some entries are empty strings. So, to capture all unmarried patients, we need to check if MARITAL_STATUS is not 'MARRIED' or is empty. But the user's intent is "unmarried", which might include single, separated, divorced, etc. However, without knowing all possible values, the safest approach is to filter where MARITAL_STATUS is not 'MARRIED'. But in the data, "SINGLE" and "SEPARATED" are present. So the condition would be WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" != 'MARRIED'. But what about NULLs or empty strings? The third patient has an empty string. If empty string is considered as unmarried, then we should include that. So perhaps the condition is WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" != 'MARRIED' OR DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" IS NULL OR DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" = ''. But handling all cases might complicate. Alternatively, if the data uses 'SINGLE' for unmarried, but the user's question is to find unmarried, which could include multiple statuses. However, the user's question is straightforward: "unmarried patients". So perhaps the correct approach is to check where MARITAL_STATUS is not 'MARRIED'. But in the data, the first entry is "SEPARATED", which is unmarried. The second is "SINGLE". So using != 'MARRIED' would include those. However, if there are other statuses like 'DIVORCED' or 'WIDOWED', they would also be included. So the condition DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" != 'MARRIED' should suffice. But what about cases where MARITAL_STATUS is NULL or empty? The third patient has an empty string. If the user considers that as unmarried, then we need to include it. But the empty string might be a data entry issue. However, the user's question is to find unmarried, so perhaps we should include all rows where MARITAL_STATUS is not 'MARRIED', regardless of other values. So the WHERE clause would be WHERE (DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" != 'MARRIED' OR DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" IS NULL) AND PROCEDURES."ICD9_CODE" = '4523'. Wait, but ICD9_CODE in procedures is an INTEGER according to the schema. Wait, looking back: the procedures table has "ICD9_CODE" as INTEGER. So in the data preview, the ICD9_CODE is 9904, 3891, 9671. So the value is stored as an integer. But the user is asking for ICD9 code 4523, which is a number. So in the SQL query, we should compare to 4523 as an integer, not a string. Wait, but in the schema, procedures.ICD9_CODE is INTEGER. So the correct condition is PROCEDURES."ICD9_CODE" = 4523. But in the example given earlier, the user's query was for ICD9 code 9951 in diagnoses, and the SQL used "DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951"". But in the diagnoses table, ICD9_CODE is TEXT, while in procedures, it's INTEGER. So in this case, since procedures.ICD9_CODE is INTEGER, we should compare to 4523 without quotes. So the condition is PROCEDURES."ICD9_CODE" = 4523. Putting it all together: We need to join DEMOGRAPHIC and PROCEDURES on HADM_ID, filter where MARITAL_STATUS is not 'MARRIED' and ICD9_CODE is 4523, then count distinct SUBJECT_ID from DEMOGRAPHIC (since each patient can have multiple admissions, but we want unique patients). Wait, but the demographic table has SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Each HADM_ID is a unique admission. So if a patient has multiple admissions (different HADM_IDs) where they were unmarried and had the procedure, we need to count them once. So COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID"). So the SQL would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID") FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PROCEDURES ON DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PROCEDURES.HADM_ID WHERE PROCEDURES."ICD9_CODE" = 4523 AND DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" != 'MARRIED'; But wait, what if MARITAL_STATUS is NULL or empty string? Should those be considered unmarried? The example data has a patient with MARITAL_STATUS as empty string. The user's question is about unmarried patients. If the empty string is considered unmarried, then the condition should be DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" != 'MARRIED' OR DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" IS NULL OR DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" = ''. But in SQLite, empty string is not the same as NULL. So to cover both cases, perhaps: (DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" != 'MARRIED' OR DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" IS NULL OR DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" = '') But the user's question is "unmarried", which may or may not include those with unknown (empty or NULL) status. However, the example given in the data_preview shows that the third patient has an empty MARITAL_STATUS and EXPIRE_FLAG 1 (died). But the user's intent is likely to include all patients not explicitly marked as married. So to be safe, perhaps the condition is DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" != 'MARRIED'. But in the data, "SEPARATED" and "SINGLE" are considered, and empty string is another case. If the user considers empty as unmarried, then we need to include it. But without explicit information, it's better to follow the user's instruction as "unmarried", which would exclude only those with 'MARRIED' status. So the condition is DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" != 'MARRIED'. However, in SQL, if the field is NULL, the comparison != 'MARRIED' would not include NULLs. So to include NULLs, we need to add OR DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" IS NULL. Similarly, empty strings would be treated as != 'MARRIED' if they are empty. For example, '' != '

QUESTION: Get the number of patients who died in or before 2132 and were less than 72 years of age.

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."AGE" < "72" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."DOD_YEAR" <= "2132.0"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the number of patients who died in or before 2132 and were less than 72 years old. First, I need to identify the relevant table. The question involves patient deaths and age, so the demographic table is the right place. The demographic table has EXPIRE_FLAG, DOD_YEAR, and AGE columns. Wait, the EXPIRE_FLAG indicates if the patient died. So I should check where EXPIRE_FLAG is 1. Then, DOD_YEAR should be <= 2132. Also, the patient's age must be less than 72. But wait, the AGE column in the demographic table—does it represent age at admission or at death? The user probably means age at death. However, the data preview shows that AGE is a column in demographic. Assuming that AGE is correct as stored. So, the condition would be AGE < 72. So the query should select COUNT(DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID) from demographic where EXPIRE_FLAG = 1, DOD_YEAR <= 2132, and AGE < 72. Wait, but in the schema, the demographic table has DOB_YEAR and DOD_YEAR. Maybe AGE is calculated as DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR? But the data preview shows a patient with DOB_YEAR 2094 and DOD_YEAR 2165, AGE 70. So 2165 - 2094 = 71, but AGE is 70. Hmm, maybe AGE is calculated at admission. So if the user wants age at death, perhaps we need to compute it as DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR. But the question says "were less than 72 years of age"—does that refer to at time of death or at admission? The user's question is about patients who died in or before 2132 and were less than 72. If AGE is their age at admission, that might not reflect their age at death. For example, if a patient was admitted at 70, died two years later (AGE would still be 70 in the table?), but DOD_YEAR would be admission year + days_stay/365, but that's complicated. But according to the data preview, the first entry has DOB_YEAR 2094, DOD_YEAR 2165, and AGE 70. 2165 - 2094 = 71, but AGE is 70. So perhaps AGE is age at admission. Therefore, if the user wants age at death, we need to calculate it as DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR. But the problem is that the AGE column might not accurately reflect that. However, the user's question specifies "were less than 72 years of age"—probably at the time of death. So we should compute DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR < 72. But the schema has AGE as a column. So which one to use? The user might not know the schema details. The question says "less than 72 years of age"—so perhaps using the AGE column is sufficient, but if AGE is at admission, and the patient died years later, that might not be accurate. However, given the data preview example, the AGE is 70 when DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR is 71. So perhaps AGE is age at admission, and the actual age at death would be higher. Therefore, relying on AGE might undercount. But the user's question might be based on the data as stored in AGE. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using the AGE column directly. The user's instruction says to use the schema provided. The demographic table has AGE, DOB_YEAR, DOD_YEAR. The question is whether to use AGE <72 or (DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR) <72. The data preview shows a patient with AGE 70, DOB_YEAR 2094, DOD_YEAR 2165. 2165-2094=71, but AGE is 70. So perhaps AGE is age at admission, and the actual age at death is higher. Therefore, to accurately get patients who were less than 72 when they died, we should compute DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR <72. But the problem is that DOD_YEAR might not be present if the patient didn't die. Wait, but in the WHERE clause, we have EXPIRE_FLAG =1, so DOD_YEAR is present. So the correct approach is to calculate (DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR) <72. But the schema has AGE as a column. However, the user's question might be based on the AGE column. But given the data discrepancy, perhaps the intended solution is to use the AGE column. But the user's question is about age at death, which might not be the same as AGE at admission. This is a bit ambiguous. Looking back at the job description: when the user asks for age, we should use the demographic.AGE column unless specified otherwise. But in this case, the user says "were less than 72 years of age"—does that refer to at time of death? If so, then using DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR would be more accurate. But the data preview shows that AGE is not the same as DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR. For example, the first patient has DOD_YEAR 2165, DOB_YEAR 2094: 71 years old at death, but AGE is 70. So if the user wants age at death, we need to compute it. However, the problem is that the schema doesn't have a column for age at death. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is to use the AGE column, assuming that the age is correct as stored. But that might not align with the user's intent. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that AGE is the age at death, but that's not the case. This is a bit of a dilemma. The job description says to assume the SQLITE database and prefer simple solutions. The schema has AGE, so perhaps the intended solution is to use AGE <72. But given that the data shows AGE is not the same as DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR, maybe the correct approach is to compute the age as DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR. However, the user's question might not be aware of this nuance. The user's question is: "patients who died in or before 2132 and were less than 72 years of age." The "were less than 72" probably refers to their age at the time of death. Therefore, the correct approach is to calculate DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR <72. But how to do that in SQL. So the WHERE clause would be: WHERE demographic.EXPIRE_FLAG = 1 AND demographic.DOD_YEAR <= 2132 AND (demographic.DOD_YEAR - demographic.DOB_YEAR) < 72 But wait, the data preview shows a patient with DOB_YEAR 2094 and DOD_YEAR 2165, which is 71 years difference, but AGE is 70. So perhaps the AGE is at admission, and the actual age at death is higher. Therefore, using DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR would give the correct age at death. But the problem is that the user might not have that information and the question might expect using the AGE column. However, the AGE in the data preview is 70 when the calculated age at death is 71. So if we use AGE <72, that patient would be included, but their actual age at death is 71, which is less than 72. Wait, 71 is less than 72, so the patient would still qualify. But in the data preview, the patient's AGE is 70, which is also less than 72. So in that case, using AGE <72 would include patients who were 70 at admission but died at 71, which is still less than 72. So perhaps using AGE is sufficient. But if a patient was admitted at age 70, died two years later (age 72), then their AGE would be 70, but DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR would be 72. So in that case, using AGE would include them even though they were 72 at death. Therefore, to accurately capture age at death, we need to compute it. But the user's question is ambiguous. However, given the data schema and the job description's instruction to prefer simple solutions, perhaps the intended answer is to use the AGE column. But given that the user is asking about age at death, the correct approach is to compute DOD_YEAR - DOB_YEAR. So the SQL would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT demographic."SUBJECT_ID") FROM demographic WHERE demographic."EXPIRE_FLAG" = 1 AND demographic."DOD_YEAR" <= 2132 AND (demographic."DOD_YEAR" - demographic."DOB_YEAR") < 72 But wait, in SQLite, subtraction is allowed. So this should work. Alternatively, if the user intended AGE <72, then: AND demographic."AGE" <72 But which is correct? The question is about patients who were less than 72 when they died. If AGE is their age at admission, and they died later, their age at death would be higher. So using AGE might not capture the correct value. For example, a patient admitted at age 70, stayed for 2 years, died at 72. Their AGE is 70, but they were 72 when they died. The user's query would exclude them because 72 is not less than 72. But

QUESTION: calculate the minimum age of medicaid insurance patients who have cerebral aneurysm/sda primary disease.

TRUE: SELECT MIN ( DEMOGRAPHIC."AGE" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."INSURANCE" = "Medicaid" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS" = "CEREBRAL ANEURYSM/SDA"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the minimum age of Medicaid insurance patients with a primary disease of cerebral aneurysm or SDA. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The insurance information is in the demographic table, and the diagnosis is in the diagnoses table. So I'll need to join these two tables on HADM_ID since that's the common key. The primary disease is in the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS column. The user mentioned "cerebral aneurysm/sda" as the primary disease. I should check if the DIAGNOSIS field contains either of these terms. Using LIKE with wildcards might be necessary, but the example shows exact matches. Wait, the data preview shows DIAGNOSIS as "SEPSIS" and "HEPATITIS B", so maybe the entries are exact. But the user wrote "primary disease", so perhaps the DIAGNOSIS column is the right place. However, the diagnoses table has SHORT_TITLE for specific diagnoses. Wait, the note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So maybe the user's mention of "primary disease" refers to the DIAGNOSIS in demographic, but the example uses diagnoses.ICD9_CODE. Hmm, the user's question is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the question. The user says "primary disease", which might be the DIAGNOSIS in demographic. But the example uses the diagnoses table for ICD9 codes. Wait, the note says: "diagnoses: use this table when asked about diagnoses on patients, like what patients had cancer". So if the user is asking about a specific diagnosis like cerebral aneurysm, that's in the diagnoses table. But the primary diagnosis is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. The user might be conflating the two. Let me check the data_preview for DIAGNOSIS in demographic: it has entries like "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B". So if the primary diagnosis is cerebral aneurysm, that would be in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But the diagnoses table has SHORT_TITLEs like "Hyposmolality", "CHF NOS". So perhaps the user's "cerebral aneurysm/sda" is a SHORT_TITLE in the diagnoses table. But the note says to use SHORT_TITLE for exact terms. Wait, the user's question says "primary disease", which is likely the main diagnosis stored in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But maybe the actual condition is in diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE. This is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to look for patients with a diagnosis (from diagnoses table) where SHORT_TITLE is "cerebral aneurysm" or "sda". But "sda" isn't a standard term. Maybe it's a typo or abbreviation. Alternatively, perhaps the primary disease in demographic.DIAGNOSIS is "cerebral aneurysm/sda". But that seems unlikely. Let me check the data_preview for DIAGNOSIS in demographic: the examples are "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B". So if the user's primary disease is "cerebral aneurysm", it would be in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. However, the note says to use the diagnoses table for specific diagnoses. Hmm. Wait, the user's question says "primary disease", which is probably the main diagnosis listed in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. So to find patients with DIAGNOSIS as 'cerebral aneurysm' or 'sda', but maybe the actual data uses a different term. Alternatively, if the diagnosis is in the diagnoses table, then we need to join on HADM_ID and look for SHORT_TITLEs matching those terms. But the note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user mentions "cerebral aneurysm" as a diagnosis, we should look in diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE for exact matches. But the user wrote "cerebral aneurysm/sda" which might be two separate terms. So perhaps the correct approach is to join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID, filter where demographic.INSURANCE is 'Medicaid' and diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE is either 'cerebral aneurysm' or 'sda', then find the minimum age from demographic. But wait, the demographic table has the AGE column. So the steps are: 1. Join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID. 2. Filter where demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicaid'. 3. Filter where diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE IN ('cerebral aneurysm', 'sda'). 4. Select the MIN(demographic.AGE). But the user's question says "primary disease", which might refer to the main diagnosis in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But according to the note, for specific diagnoses like cancer, use the diagnoses table. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the diagnoses table for the condition. However, the example given in the data_preview for diagnoses has SHORT_TITLEs like "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". So if "cerebral aneurysm" is a SHORT_TITLE, then we should use that. But the user's question has "cerebral aneurysm/sda" as the primary disease. Maybe that's a typo, or perhaps it's two separate conditions. The slash might mean "or", so the SHORT_TITLE should be either 'cerebral aneurysm' or 'sda'. However, 'sda' doesn't seem like a standard medical term. Maybe it's an abbreviation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and the intended term is 'SAH' (subarachnoid hemorrhage) or something else. But given the user's input, we have to take it as is. So assuming that the SHORT_TITLE in diagnoses is exactly 'cerebral aneurysm' or 'sda', the query would join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID, filter for INSURANCE = 'Medicaid' and SHORT_TITLE in those values, then select the minimum age. Wait, but the demographic table has one row per HADM_ID, right? Because each HADM_ID is a hospital admission. So a patient can have multiple diagnoses, hence multiple rows in diagnoses for the same HADM_ID. So joining on HADM_ID would link the demographic info with each diagnosis. Then, filtering for those diagnoses would give us the patients with at least one of those diagnoses, and we can get their age from demographic. So the SQL would be: SELECT MIN(demographic.AGE) FROM demographic INNER JOIN diagnoses ON demographic.HADM_ID = diagnoses.HADM_ID WHERE demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicaid' AND (diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE = 'cerebral aneurysm' OR diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE = 'sda'); But the note says to use exact terms as asked. The user wrote "cerebral aneurysm/sda", which might be a single term with a slash, but in the data, SHORT_TITLEs don't have slashes. So perhaps the user intended two separate conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the correct SHORT_TITLE is 'cerebral aneurysm/sda' as a single term. But without knowing the actual data, we have to go by the user's input. Alternatively, maybe the primary disease is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, so the query would be: SELECT MIN(AGE) FROM demographic WHERE INSURANCE = 'Medicaid' AND DIAGNOSIS IN ('cerebral aneurysm', 'sda'); But the note says to use diagnoses table for specific diagnoses. The example given in the data_preview for DIAGNOSIS in demographic is "SEPSIS", which is a general diagnosis. So perhaps the primary disease is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, and specific conditions are in diagnoses. But the user's question is about a specific condition, which would be in diagnoses. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example given in the job description. The example query was for ICD9 code 9951, which is in the diagnoses table. So when the user asks about a diagnosis, the correct approach is to use the diagnoses table. Therefore, even though the user mentioned "primary disease", which might be in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, the correct approach is to use the diagnoses table's SHORT_TITLE. So the correct SQL would join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID, filter for insurance = 'Medicaid' and SHORT_TITLE in ('cerebral aneurysm', 'sda'), then select the minimum age from demographic. But wait, the demographic table's INSURANCE field in the data_preview has values like 'Medicare' and 'Private'. So the correct value is 'Medicaid' as per the user's question. Also, the AGE column is in demographic, so after joining, we can get the AGE from there. So the final query would be: SELECT MIN(demographic.AGE) FROM demographic INNER JOIN diagnoses ON demographic.HADM_ID = diagnoses.HADM_ID WHERE demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicaid' AND (diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE = 'cerebral aneurysm' OR diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE = 'sda'); But the user wrote "sda" which might not exist in the data. However, the task is to translate the user's question as is, assuming that the terms exist. Another consideration: the user might have meant "SAH" (subarachnoid hemorrhage), but that's speculation. We have to go with the given terms. Also, the note says to wrap column names in quotes and prefix with table names. So

QUESTION: how many patients with tietze's disease are insured by the government?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."INSURANCE" = "Government" AND DIAGNOSES."LONG_TITLE" = "Tietze's disease"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants to know how many patients with Tietze's disease are insured by the government. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. Tietze's disease is a diagnosis, so the diagnoses table is involved. Insurance information is in the demographic table. The question is about counting patients, so I should use DISTINCT on demographic.SUBJECT_ID. To join the tables, HADM_ID is the common key between demographic and diagnoses. In the diagnoses table, the SHORT_TITLE should be checked for 'Tietze's disease'. Since the example uses exact matches, I'll use LOWER(DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE) = 'tietze's disease' to ensure case insensitivity. For insurance, the user specified "government". Looking at the data preview, insurance values like 'Medicare' are present. So, I'll check where demographic.INSURANCE is in government-related options. Maybe using IN ('Medicare', 'Medicaid') or similar. But the user said "government", so perhaps the exact term is 'Government'? Wait, in the data preview, the insurance column has 'Medicare' and 'Private'. Maybe the actual value for government is 'Government'? But the example data shows 'Medicare' as insurance. The user might consider Medicare as government insurance. Hmm, but the question says "insured by the government", so perhaps the INSURANCE column has values like 'Government' or 'Medicare' is considered government. Looking at the data_preview for demographic, the INSURANCE column has 'Medicare' and 'Private'. So in the sample data, 'Medicare' is a government insurance. So the condition would be demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicare' OR other government types. But the user's question is general, so maybe the INSURANCE field has a value that directly states 'Government'. Alternatively, perhaps the possible values are 'Medicare', 'Medicaid', etc., which are government programs. But without knowing all possible values, the safest approach is to use LOWER(demographic.INSURANCE) LIKE '%government%' to capture any insurance that includes the word government. However, in the data preview, 'Medicare' is listed, which is a government program, but the term 'government' isn't in the value. So maybe the user considers 'Medicare' as government. But the question is phrased as "insured by the government", so perhaps the insurance type is 'Government' exactly. But in the data, it's 'Medicare'. Wait, the user provided a data preview where one row has INSURANCE as 'Medicare' and another as 'Private'. So perhaps in this database, government insurance is represented by 'Medicare' or 'Medicaid', but the exact term isn't present. Alternatively, maybe the user expects us to use 'Government' as the value. But since the data shows 'Medicare', perhaps the correct approach is to check for INSURANCE in ('Medicare', 'Medicaid') or similar. However, the user's question is about "government" insurance, so maybe the correct filter is WHERE demographic.INSURANCE = 'Government'. But in the data, it's 'Medicare'. This is a problem. Wait, the user instruction says: When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked. So for diagnoses, we use exact match on SHORT_TITLE. So for Tietze's disease, the SHORT_TITLE should be exactly 'Tietze's disease'. But in the data preview, the SHORT_TITLEs are like 'Hyposmolality', 'CHF NOS'. So the exact term is important. So the condition would be DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = 'Tietze's disease'. But to make it case-insensitive, perhaps use LOWER(DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE) = 'tietze's disease'. For the insurance, the user's question is "insured by the government". In the data preview, the insurance is 'Medicare' which is a government program. But the actual value is 'Medicare', not 'Government'. So how to map that? The user might be considering 'Medicare' as government insurance. But without knowing all possible values, perhaps the correct approach is to check if INSURANCE is in a list of government insurance types. But since we don't have that list, maybe the user expects us to use 'Government' as the value. But in the data, it's 'Medicare'. This is a conflict. Wait, the user provided an example where the insurance is 'Medicare' and 'Private'. The question is about government insurance. So perhaps in this context, 'Medicare' is considered government insurance. Therefore, the condition would be demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicare'. But the user's question is about "government" insured, so maybe the correct value is 'Government'? Or perhaps the insurance field has values like 'Government' and 'Private'. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, and the correct approach is to use INSURANCE = 'Government' even if the data shows 'Medicare'. But that's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the insurance field has a value 'Government' for government-insured patients. But in the data preview, it's 'Medicare' and 'Private'. So maybe the user intended that 'Medicare' is a government insurance, so the condition is demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicare' OR demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicaid', etc. But without knowing all possible government insurance types in the data, it's hard. Wait, the user's instruction says: When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked. So for diagnoses, exact term. For insurance, perhaps the exact term is 'Government', but in the data, it's 'Medicare'. This is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the user considers 'Medicare' as a government insurance, so the condition is demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicare'. But the question is about "government" insurance, so perhaps the answer should use 'Medicare' as the value. Alternatively, maybe the insurance field has a value 'Government' which is different from 'Medicare'. But in the data preview, it's 'Medicare'. This is a bit of a dilemma. But given the example data, perhaps the correct approach is to use WHERE demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicare' as the government insurance. But the user's question is about "government" insured, so maybe the correct value is 'Government'. Alternatively, perhaps the insurance field has a category 'Government' which includes Medicare and Medicaid. But without knowing that, it's hard. Given the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to use exact terms as asked, perhaps the insurance should be matched exactly to 'Government'. But in the data, it's 'Medicare'. So this might be a problem. Wait, the user's example in the data_preview for demographic has INSURANCE as 'Medicare' and 'Private'. So perhaps in this database, 'Medicare' is considered a government insurance. Therefore, the correct condition is demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicare'. But the user's question is "insured by the government", which in real life, Medicare is a government program. So perhaps that's the intended mapping. Therefore, the SQL would join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID, filter where DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE is 'Tietze's disease' (case-insensitive), and demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicare'. Wait, but the example in the data_preview for diagnoses uses SHORT_TITLE as "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". So the exact match is needed. So for Tietze's disease, the SHORT_TITLE should be exactly 'Tietze's disease'. But to make it case-insensitive, use LOWER(DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE) = 'tietze's disease'. So putting it all together: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES ON DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE LOWER(DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE) = 'tietze's disease' AND DEMOGRAPHIC.INSURANCE = 'Medicare'; But wait, the user's question says "insured by the government", which might include more than just Medicare. But given the data preview, 'Medicare' is the only government insurance shown. Alternatively, maybe the insurance field has 'Government' as a value. But in the data preview, it's not present. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use 'Government' as the insurance value. But without knowing, it's risky. Alternatively, maybe the insurance field has 'Government' as a possible value, and the user's question is using that. So the condition would be DEMOGRAPHIC.INSURANCE = 'Government'. But in the data preview, the insurance is 'Medicare' and 'Private'. So perhaps the correct answer is to use 'Medicare' as the government insurance. But the user's question is ambiguous. However, following the example given in the job description, where the user asked for ICD9 9951 and the code uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", which is exact. So for the insurance, the exact value is needed. In the data preview, the insurance is 'Medicare', so perhaps

QUESTION: provide the number of patients whose diagnosis short title is dmi keto nt st uncontrolled and lab test category is blood gas.

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID INNER JOIN LAB on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = LAB.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."SHORT_TITLE" = "DMI keto nt st uncntrld" AND LAB."CATEGORY" = "Blood Gas"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the number of patients with a specific diagnosis short title and a lab test category. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The diagnosis short title is in the DIAGNOSES table, and the lab test category is in the LAB table. Since patients are tracked in DEMOGRAPHIC, I'll need to join these tables. The key is to count distinct patients. So, I should use COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID). For the diagnosis, the short title is "dmi keto nt st uncontrolled". The DIAGNOSES table has the SHORT_TITLE column. I'll need to filter where SHORT_TITLE matches exactly that string. But wait, the example uses quotes around the value, so I should do the same here. Also, maybe case sensitivity? The example used lowercase, but the data preview shows entries like "Hyposmolality". The user mentioned to use exact terms, so probably exact match. So WHERE DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = "dmi keto nt st uncontrolled". For the lab test category, the LAB table has CATEGORY. The user specified "blood gas", so LAB.CATEGORY = "Blood Gas"? Wait, in the data preview, the LAB entry has CATEGORY "Blood Gas". But the example in the data preview shows "Blood Gas" with a space. Wait, the user's question says "lab test category is blood gas". Should it be lowercase? The data preview has "Blood Gas" with uppercase. But the instruction says when matching strings, use LOWER(). Wait, the example given by the user in the job description uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" without lower. But the instruction says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()". Wait, the example provided by the user in the job description didn't use LOWER, but the instruction says to use LOWER. Hmm, conflicting info. Wait, the job description says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". But the example given doesn't use LOWER. Maybe the example is incorrect. The instruction says to use LOWER, so perhaps the correct approach is to apply LOWER to both the column and the value. For example, LOWER(DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE) = LOWER("dmi keto nt st uncontrolled"). But the example didn't do that. Wait, the example was for ICD9_CODE which is a number, so maybe that's why. For text fields, the instruction says to use LOWER. So in this case, for SHORT_TITLE and CATEGORY, we should use LOWER. But looking at the data preview for DIAGNOSES, the SHORT_TITLE entries are like "Hyposmolality" with capital letters. If the user's query is "dmi keto nt st uncontrolled", which is lowercase, then using LOWER would make the comparison case-insensitive. So the correct condition would be LOWER(DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE) = LOWER("dmi keto nt st uncontrolled"). Similarly for LAB.CATEGORY: the data preview has "Blood Gas", so if the user says "blood gas", using LOWER would match. But the example in the job description didn't use LOWER for ICD9_CODE, which is a string but perhaps stored as a code. So maybe for text fields that are codes (like ICD9_CODE), exact case is used, but for titles and categories, case-insensitive. The user's instruction says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". Wait, in the schema description for DIAGNOSES, it says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user provides the exact term, we should match exactly. So if the user says the short title is "dmi keto nt st uncontrolled", we need to match that exact string, case-sensitive. But in the data preview, the SHORT_TITLE entries have capital letters. So maybe the user's input might not match the case in the data. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, the user's instruction under [schema] says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user provides the exact term, we should match it exactly. So if the user's query is "dmi keto nt st uncontrolled", then we should look for SHORT_TITLE exactly that. But in the data preview, the SHORT_TITLEs are in title case. So unless the actual data has entries that exactly match "dmi keto nt st uncontrolled", which is all lowercase, the query might not find anything. But the user might be using a specific term that's stored in the database as is. So perhaps the correct approach is to match exactly as provided, without lowercasing. But the job description's instruction says to use LOWER when matching strings. There's a conflict here. Wait, the job description's example for the user query "Find all patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951" uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". So no LOWER there. But ICD9_CODE is a string, perhaps with numbers. For text fields like SHORT_TITLE, the instruction says to use exact term as asked. So if the user provides "dmi keto nt st uncontrolled", we should match that exact string. However, in the data preview, the SHORT_TITLEs are in title case. So unless the actual data has entries that match exactly the user's input, this might not work. But according to the user's instruction under the schema, for DIAGNOSES, "use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So the user's input is the exact term. Therefore, the SQL should use DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = "dmi keto nt st uncontrolled" without lowercasing. Similarly, for LAB.CATEGORY, the user says "blood gas", but in the data preview, the category is "Blood Gas". So unless we use LOWER, it won't match. But the instruction says to use LOWER when matching strings. So perhaps the correct approach is to apply LOWER to both the column and the value. For example, LOWER(DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE) = LOWER("dmi keto nt st uncontrolled") and LOWER(LAB.CATEGORY) = LOWER("blood gas"). But the example didn't do that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user's data has the SHORT_TITLE stored as "DMI Keto NT ST Uncontrolled", and the user's query is using the exact term. But the user wrote "dmi keto nt st uncontrolled" in lowercase. So unless the data has the exact lowercase version, the match won't work. But according to the schema instruction, we should search by exact term as asked. So perhaps the user's input is the exact term, and the data has it in that case. But in the data preview, the SHORT_TITLEs are in title case, like "Hyposmolality". So maybe the user made a typo, but according to the instructions, we should take the user's input as exact. This is a bit conflicting. The job description says to use LOWER when matching strings, but the schema says to use exact term for SHORT_TITLE. So which takes precedence? The schema's note is more specific, so perhaps for DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE, we should use exact match. For LAB.CATEGORY, since there's no such note, we should use LOWER. Wait, the schema says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So for DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE, exact match. For LAB.CATEGORY, since there's no such instruction, use LOWER. So the DIAGNOSES condition would be SHORT_TITLE = "dmi keto nt st uncontrolled", and LAB.CATEGORY would be LOWER(CATEGORY) = "blood gas". But in the data preview, LAB.CATEGORY is "Blood Gas", so LOWER("Blood Gas") is "blood gas", which matches the user's input. So for LAB, we need to use LOWER(LAB.CATEGORY) = LOWER("blood gas"). But the user's input is "blood gas", so LOWER("blood gas") is same as the input. Alternatively, just compare as lowercase. So putting it all together: We need to join DEMOGRAPHIC, DIAGNOSES, and LAB tables. The joins are on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID? Wait, DEMOGRAPHIC has SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. DIAGNOSES also has SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Similarly for LAB. So to link a patient's demographic info with their diagnoses and lab tests, we need to join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID? Or just SUBJECT_ID? Because a patient (SUBJECT_ID) can have multiple HADM_IDs (hospital admissions). So each HADM_ID is a specific admission. So if a diagnosis and a lab test are from the same admission, then joining on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID would be correct. But if the user wants patients who have both the diagnosis and the lab test in any of their admissions, then maybe we need to join on SUBJECT_ID only. But the question is about patients (count of distinct SUBJECT_ID) who have at least one diagnosis with the given short title and at least one lab test in the blood gas category, regardless of admission

QUESTION: how many patients whose primary disease was syncope;telemetry died in or before year 2179?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS" = "SYNCOPE;TELEMETRY" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."DOD_YEAR" <= "2179.0"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants to know how many patients had syncope as their primary disease and died in or before 2179. First, I need to identify the primary disease. The demographic table has a DIAGNOSIS column, which likely holds the primary diagnosis. So, I should check where DIAGNOSIS is 'syncope'. Next, the patient's death is indicated by the EXPIRE_FLAG in demographic. If EXPIRE_FLAG is 1, the patient died. Also, the DOD_YEAR column gives the year of death. The question specifies "died in or before 2179", so DOD_YEAR should be <= 2179. But wait, the user mentioned "telemetry" in the question. Hmm, maybe that's part of the diagnosis or a procedure? Looking at the schema, diagnoses have SHORT_TITLE. But the example given uses DIAGNOSES.ICD9_CODE for specific codes. However, the user instruction says when asked to use SHORT_TITLE to search, use exact terms. The data preview shows diagnoses with SHORT_TITLE like 'Hyposmolality'. Wait, the user's question says "primary disease was syncope;telemetry". The semicolon might be separating two terms. Maybe they mean either syncope or telemetry? Or is telemetry part of the diagnosis? Or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe "syncope;telemetry" is a specific code or term. But in the data preview, diagnoses have SHORT_TITLES like 'Hyposmolality' and 'CHF NOS'. Maybe the user intended to include both 'syncope' and 'telemetry' as diagnoses? Or perhaps 'telemetry' refers to a procedure? Wait, the procedures table has SHORT_TITLEs like 'Packed cell transfusion'. If 'telemetry' is a procedure, then we need to check the procedures table. But the user's question says "primary disease was syncope;telemetry". That might be a mistake, perhaps they meant the primary diagnosis is syncope and they had telemetry as a procedure. Or maybe it's a typo and they meant "syncope and telemetry" as part of the diagnosis. Alternatively, maybe the semicolon is a separator for two conditions: primary disease syncope and telemetry. But telemetry is a monitoring procedure, not a disease. So perhaps the user made an error here. But I need to work with what's given. Assuming that the primary disease is syncope, and perhaps 'telemetry' is another condition. But looking at the data, the DIAGNOSIS field in demographic is a single string. For example, in the data preview, DIAGNOSIS is 'SEPSIS', 'HEPATITIS B', etc. So the primary diagnosis is a single term. Therefore, the user might have a typo, and perhaps meant the primary diagnosis is 'syncope' and they want patients who also had a telemetry procedure. Wait, the question is "patients whose primary disease was syncope;telemetry died...". The semicolon might be separating two terms, but in the demographic table, DIAGNOSIS is a single value. So maybe the user intended to have both 'syncope' and 'telemetry' as part of the primary diagnosis, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake, and they meant the primary diagnosis is syncope, and they had a telemetry procedure. Alternatively, perhaps 'syncope;telemetry' is a specific code or a combined term in the DIAGNOSIS field. But in the data preview, DIAGNOSIS is a single term like 'SEPSIS'. So perhaps the user made a typo, and the primary disease is 'syncope' and they want patients who also had a telemetry-related procedure. But the question is a bit unclear. However, given the user's instruction to use SHORT_TITLE for diagnoses, but the example uses ICD9_CODE. Wait, the user instruction says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the question is about diagnoses, we should use the SHORT_TITLE in the diagnoses table. But the primary disease is in the demographic's DIAGNOSIS column. Wait, the schema says demographic has a DIAGNOSIS column, which is the primary diagnosis. So for the primary disease, we should look at demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But the user's example uses the diagnoses table for ICD9 codes. Hmm. Wait, the example given in the job description is: User asks for patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951, and the SQL joins demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID, filtering by ICD9_CODE. So for specific diagnoses (like ICD9 codes), we use the diagnoses table. But the primary diagnosis is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. So if the user is asking about the primary disease (demographic.DIAGNOSIS) being syncope, then we need to filter demographic.DIAGNOSIS = 'syncope'. But if they are asking about any diagnosis of syncope, then we need to join with diagnoses and check SHORT_TITLE. The user's question is: "how many patients whose primary disease was syncope;telemetry died in or before year 2179?" The term "primary disease" suggests using the demographic.DIAGNOSIS column. But the presence of 'syncope;telemetry' is confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant 'syncope' and 'telemetry' as two separate conditions. But in the demographic table, each patient has one primary diagnosis. So perhaps the user intended to have patients whose primary disease is syncope and also had a telemetry procedure. Or maybe 'telemetry' is part of the diagnosis. Alternatively, maybe the semicolon is a typo, and they meant 'syncope and telemetry' as the primary disease, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the user is using ';' to denote OR, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe 'syncope;telemetry' is a specific code in the diagnoses.ICD9_CODE, but the data preview shows ICD9 codes as numbers. For example, "ICD9_CODE" in diagnoses is "2761", "4280", etc. So 'syncope;telemetry' is not an ICD9 code. Therefore, perhaps the user is referring to the SHORT_TITLE in diagnoses. But the example shows that when the user asks for ICD9 code 9951, the SQL uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". But the instruction says when asked to use SHORT_TITLE, search by exact term. So if the user mentions a diagnosis term like 'syncope', we should check the SHORT_TITLE in diagnoses. But the question says "primary disease", which is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. So perhaps the user is conflating primary diagnosis (demographic.DIAGNOSIS) with other diagnoses (diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE). So the user might want patients where their primary disease (demographic.DIAGNOSIS) is 'syncope' and also have a diagnosis of 'telemetry' in the diagnoses table. But 'telemetry' as a diagnosis doesn't make sense; telemetry is a procedure. So perhaps the user made a mistake, and 'telemetry' refers to a procedure. Alternatively, maybe 'telemetry' is part of the primary diagnosis. For example, the DIAGNOSIS field in demographic could be 'syncope; telemetry' as a combined entry. But in the data preview, DIAGNOSIS is a single term like 'SEPSIS'. So that's unlikely. This is a bit ambiguous. But given the user's question, I need to proceed with the information I have. Assuming that the primary disease is 'syncope' (demographic.DIAGNOSIS = 'syncope'), and the patient died (EXPIRE_FLAG = 1) in or before 2179 (DOD_YEAR <= 2179). The 'telemetry' part is unclear. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps the user intended to include another condition. If 'telemetry' is a procedure, then we need to check the procedures table for procedures with SHORT_TITLE 'telemetry'. But looking at the procedures data preview, there's 'Arterial catheterization', 'Packed cell transfusion', etc. No 'telemetry' there. Alternatively, maybe 'telemetry' is a drug in prescriptions, but that's also unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps 'telemetry' is part of the diagnosis's SHORT_TITLE. For example, a diagnosis with SHORT_TITLE 'syncope and telemetry'. But that's speculative. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended to ask for patients whose primary disease was syncope and who died in or before 2179. The 'telemetry' part might be a mistake or irrelevant. But since it's in the question, I can't ignore it. Alternatively, maybe 'syncope;telemetry' is the exact DIAGNOSIS string. For example, if the DIAGNOSIS column has entries like 'syncope;telemetry', then we need to match that exactly. But in the data preview, DIAGNOSIS is a single term. So perhaps the user made a typo, and the semicolon is meant to separate two conditions: primary disease syncope and another condition telemetry. But telemetry isn't a diagnosis; it's a procedure. So perhaps the user meant that the patient had a telemetry procedure. In that case, the query would involve joining demographic (for primary diagnosis syncope and death info) with procedures (for telemetry procedure

QUESTION: how many patients were admitted in emergency primarily for t5 fracture?

TRUE: SELECT AVG ( DEMOGRAPHIC."AGE" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."ADMISSION_TYPE" = "EMERGENCY" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS" = "T5 FRACTURE"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user is asking for the number of patients admitted in emergency primarily for a T5 fracture. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The demographic table has admission details, and diagnoses would have the primary diagnosis. The question mentions "admitted in emergency primarily for," so ADMISSION_TYPE in demographic should be 'EMERGENCY', and the primary diagnosis (DIAGNOSIS column in demographic) should be T5 fracture. Wait, the DIAGNOSIS field in demographic is the primary diagnosis upon admission. So I can join demographic on itself? Or maybe check the DIAGNOSES table for the ICD9 code. But the user mentioned "primarily for," which is the DIAGNOSIS in demographic. However, the example given uses the DIAGNOSES table. Hmm, need to check the schema again. Looking at the schema, the demographic table has a DIAGNOSIS column, which is the primary diagnosis. The DIAGNOSES table lists all diagnoses for a patient. The user's question says "primarily for," so the primary diagnosis in demographic is the right place. But the example uses DIAGNOSES. Maybe the example is when the primary diagnosis isn't in demographic? Or perhaps the DIAGNOSES table's SHORT_TITLE is used for the condition. Wait, the data_preview shows that in DIAGNOSES, the SHORT_TITLE is used, like "Hyposmolality". The user's example query uses DIAGNOSES.ICD9_CODE. But the current question is about T5 fracture, which might be a SHORT_TITLE. However, the note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked." So for diagnoses, we should look at the DIAGNOSES table's SHORT_TITLE. But the question says "admitted in emergency primarily for". The primary reason for admission is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. Wait, the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS is the primary diagnosis. So maybe we need to check both: admission type is emergency in demographic, and the primary diagnosis (DIAGNOSIS column) is T5 fracture. But the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is a text field. For example, in the data preview, one DIAGNOSIS is "SEPSIS". Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is also recorded in the DIAGNOSES table with a certain priority. But according to the schema, the DIAGNOSES table doesn't have a priority field. So perhaps the primary diagnosis is the one listed in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, and the DIAGNOSES table includes all secondary diagnoses as well. Wait, the user's example was: "Find all patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951" and the SQL joined DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID, checking ICD9_CODE. So in that case, the DIAGNOSES table is used for the diagnosis code. But the current question is about the primary reason for admission, which is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But the user's question says "primarily for T5 fracture", which would be the primary diagnosis. However, T5 fracture is a specific diagnosis, which might be represented by an ICD9 code in the DIAGNOSES table. But the note says to use SHORT_TITLE for exact matches. So perhaps the primary diagnosis in demographic.DIAGNOSIS is a text description, and the DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE is the exact term. Wait, the data_preview for DIAGNOSES shows SHORT_TITLE like "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". The demographic.DIAGNOSIS in the data preview is "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B", etc. So if the user is asking for T5 fracture, which is a specific diagnosis, it's possible that the primary diagnosis (demographic.DIAGNOSIS) would have that term, or it's in the DIAGNOSES table with SHORT_TITLE. But the note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked." So if the user mentions a diagnosis like "T5 fracture", we should look in DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE for an exact match. However, the question specifies "primarily for", which implies the primary diagnosis. So perhaps the primary diagnosis is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, but how is that linked to the DIAGNOSES table? Or maybe the primary diagnosis is the first entry in DIAGNOSES for that HADM_ID. This is a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the schema notes: - demographic: DIAGNOSIS is the primary diagnosis upon admission. - diagnoses: use this table when asked about diagnoses on patients, like what patients had cancer. So if the question is about the primary diagnosis, we should use demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But the example given in the job description uses the DIAGNOSES table. For example, the user asked about ICD9 code 9951, which is in DIAGNOSES.ICD9_CODE. But the current question is about "primarily for T5 fracture", which is the primary diagnosis. So perhaps the primary diagnosis is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, and we need to check if that field contains "T5 fracture". Looking at the data preview for demographic.DIAGNOSIS: "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B", "SEPSIS". So the DIAGNOSIS field is a text description. Therefore, if the user is asking for T5 fracture as the primary diagnosis, we need to check demographic.DIAGNOSIS for that exact term. However, the note says that for diagnoses, use the DIAGNOSES table and SHORT_TITLE for exact matches. So there's a conflict here. Wait, the note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked." So if the user mentions a diagnosis term, we should use the DIAGNOSES table's SHORT_TITLE. But if the question is about the primary diagnosis (demographic.DIAGNOSIS), then we need to check that field. However, the user's question is "admitted in emergency primarily for T5 fracture". The "primarily" suggests it's the main reason for admission, which is the demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But if the data in demographic.DIAGNOSIS is a text field like "SEPSIS", then "T5 fracture" would need to match that. Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is also recorded in the DIAGNOSES table with a certain code. This is a bit ambiguous. Let's see the example again. The example user asked for ICD9 code 9951, which is in DIAGNOSES. So the example uses DIAGNOSES.ICD9_CODE. But the current question is about a diagnosis term (T5 fracture), which would be in DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE. However, the "primarily" part might refer to the primary diagnosis in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But how is that linked? Alternatively, perhaps the primary diagnosis is the first entry in the DIAGNOSES table for that HADM_ID. But the schema doesn't indicate any ordering in DIAGNOSES. So this is unclear. Given the note says to use SHORT_TITLE for exact matches when asked about diagnoses, perhaps the correct approach is to join DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID, filter for ADMISSION_TYPE = 'EMERGENCY' in demographic, and DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = 'T5 fracture'. But the "primarily" part is tricky. If "primarily" means the main diagnosis, perhaps it's the one in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But in the data preview, demographic.DIAGNOSIS has entries like "SEPSIS", which might correspond to a SHORT_TITLE in DIAGNOSES. Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is the one with a specific ICD9 code in DIAGNOSES. But without knowing which ICD9 code corresponds to T5 fracture, it's hard. However, the user's question uses the term "T5 fracture" as the diagnosis, so we should match DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE exactly to that term. So the steps would be: 1. Join DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID. 2. Filter where DEMOGRAPHIC.ADMISSION_TYPE is 'EMERGENCY'. 3. Filter where DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE is 'T5 fracture'. 4. Count distinct SUBJECT_ID from DEMOGRAPHIC. But wait, the note says when counting patients, count by demographic.subject_id. So the COUNT should be on DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID, distinct. But the user is asking for patients admitted in emergency primarily for T5 fracture. So perhaps the primary diagnosis is in DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE, but how to ensure it's the primary? Maybe the primary diagnosis is the one with a certain priority, but the schema doesn't have that. Alternatively, if the primary diagnosis is the one listed in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, but that's a text field. For example, in the data preview, demographic.DIAGNOSIS is "SEPSIS", which might correspond to a SHORT_TITLE in DIAGNOSES. But the user's question is about "T5 fracture" as the primary reason. If the primary reason is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, then we need to check if that field equals 'T5 fracture'. However, in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS field has

QUESTION: count the number of patients who were transferred within the facility and were discharged to home.

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."ADMISSION_LOCATION" = "TRSF WITHIN THIS FACILITY" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."DISCHARGE_LOCATION" = "HOME"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants to count the number of patients who were transferred within the facility and discharged to home. First, I need to look at the tables provided. The demographic table has the admission and discharge locations. The question mentions "transferred within the facility," so I should check the ADMISSION_LOCATION. The schema shows that ADMISSION_LOCATION in demographic has values like "EMERGENCY ROOM ADMIT" and "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM". Wait, the example data shows "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM" as an admission location. But the user is asking about transfers within the facility. Maybe "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM" refers to external transfers, but perhaps there's another code for internal transfers. However, based on the data preview, the possible values might be limited. Let me check the data_preview section. Looking at the data_preview for demographic, one entry has ADMISSION_LOCATION as "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM". The user's question is about being transferred within the facility. Maybe the correct value is "TRANSFER WITHIN FACILITY" or similar. But in the provided data, I don't see that. Wait, maybe the ADMISSION_TYPE column? Let me check the schema again. The demographic table has ADMISSION_TYPE, which in the example data includes "EMERGENCY". But the user is referring to the admission location, not type. Hmm, perhaps the ADMISSION_LOCATION has a value that indicates transfer within the facility. The example data shows "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM" which might be external. Maybe the correct value is something like "TRANSFER FROM OTHER FACILITY" or "TRANSFER WITHIN". But given the data we have, perhaps the exact string to match is "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM" or another value. Wait, the user's question says "transferred within the facility", which implies internal transfer. But in the data preview, the ADMISSION_LOCATION for a patient is "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM", which might be external. This could be a discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe the ADMISSION_TYPE column has a value indicating transfer. Let me check the schema again. The demographic table has ADMISSION_TYPE, which in the example data includes "EMERGENCY". The possible values aren't listed, but perhaps "TRANSFER" is a possible ADMISSION_TYPE. However, the user's question specifically mentions "transferred within the facility", which is likely about the admission location. Assuming that the ADMISSION_LOCATION has a value that indicates transfer within the facility, but in the data preview, the only transfer-related value is "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM". Maybe that's the closest match. Alternatively, perhaps the correct value is "TRANSFER" or "TRANSFER WITHIN". But without more data examples, I have to go by what's provided. Wait, the user's question is to count patients who were "transferred within the facility". The correct ADMISSION_LOCATION for that might be "TRANSFER WITHIN FACILITY" or similar. But in the data preview, the admission locations are "EMERGENCY ROOM ADMIT", "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM", etc. Maybe "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM" is external, and "TRANSFER FROM OTHER UNIT" would be internal. But since the data preview doesn't show that, perhaps the exact string to match is "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM". Alternatively, maybe the correct value is "TRANSFER" in ADMISSION_TYPE. Alternatively, perhaps the ADMISSION_LOCATION has a value like "TRANSFER" which indicates a transfer within the facility. But given the example data, I'm not sure. This is a potential ambiguity. However, the user's intent is to find patients transferred within the facility, so the SQL should filter on ADMISSION_LOCATION where it's a transfer within. Assuming that the correct value for ADMISSION_LOCATION is "TRANSFER WITHIN FACILITY" or similar, but in the data preview, the value is "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM". Wait, maybe "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM" means transfer from another hospital, which is external. So perhaps the correct value for within-facility transfer is a different code. But without knowing the exact possible values, I have to make an educated guess. Alternatively, maybe the ADMISSION_TYPE column is where the transfer type is indicated. For example, if ADMISSION_TYPE is "TRANSFER", that could indicate the patient was transferred. But the example data shows "EMERGENCY" as the admission type. This is a bit tricky. The user's question is to count patients who were transferred within the facility. The discharge location should be "HOME" or "HOME HEALTH CARE" as per the data preview. Wait, in the data preview, the DISCHARGE_LOCATION for one patient is "HOME HEALTH CARE" and another is "DEAD/EXPIRED". The user wants discharged to home, so maybe the DISCHARGE_LOCATION should be "HOME" or similar. Looking at the data_preview for demographic, the discharge locations are "HOME HEALTH CARE" and "DEAD/EXPIRED". So perhaps "HOME" is a possible value, but in the example, it's "HOME HEALTH CARE". The user's question says "discharged to home", which might correspond to "HOME" or "HOME HEALTH CARE". But the exact terminology matters. In the schema, the DISCHARGE_LOCATION is a TEXT field. The user's intent is patients discharged to home, so the SQL should filter where DISCHARGE_LOCATION is 'HOME' or similar. But in the data preview, the discharge location is "HOME HEALTH CARE" for one patient. So maybe the exact value is "HOME" or "HOME HEALTH CARE". The user's question might consider "HOME HEALTH CARE" as being discharged to home, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is "HOME". But without more data, it's hard to tell. The user's question says "discharged to home", so the SQL should look for DISCHARGE_LOCATION = 'HOME'. However, in the data preview, the discharge location is "HOME HEALTH CARE", which might be a different category. This is a problem because the exact values in the database matter. But given the user's question, we have to proceed with the information we have. So, putting it all together: We need to count distinct SUBJECT_ID from demographic where ADMISSION_LOCATION indicates a transfer within the facility and DISCHARGE_LOCATION is home. Assuming that ADMISSION_LOCATION for within-facility transfers is "TRANSFER WITHIN FACILITY" or similar, but in the data preview, the value is "TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM" which might be external. This is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the ADMISSION_TYPE is "TRANSFER". But the example data shows ADMISSION_TYPE as "EMERGENCY". Wait, the user's question is about being transferred within the facility. Maybe the ADMISSION_LOCATION is "TRANSFER" or "TRANSFER WITHIN". But without knowing the exact value, perhaps the correct approach is to use the ADMISSION_LOCATION that corresponds to a transfer within the facility. Alternatively, perhaps the ADMISSION_LOCATION has a value like "TRANSFER FROM OTHER UNIT" which would be within the facility. But again, without data examples, it's hard. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to use the ADMISSION_LOCATION that includes the word 'TRANSFER' and the DISCHARGE_LOCATION as 'HOME' or similar. But in the data preview, the discharge location for a patient is "HOME HEALTH CARE". So maybe the user considers that as home. Alternatively, perhaps there's a 'HOME' value. The user's question is to count patients discharged to home, so the SQL should have DISCHARGE_LOCATION = 'HOME'. But if in the data, it's 'HOME HEALTH CARE', then the count would be zero. This is a problem. The assistant needs to make an assumption here. Alternatively, perhaps the discharge location for home is 'HOME' and 'HOME HEALTH CARE' is a different category. But the user's question says "discharged to home", so we'll use 'HOME' as the value. Putting it all together: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT demographic.SUBJECT_ID) FROM demographic WHERE demographic.ADMISSION_LOCATION = 'TRANSFER WITHIN FACILITY' AND demographic.DISCHARGE_LOCATION = 'HOME'; But since in the data preview, the admission location is 'TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM', which might not be the correct value, but the user's question is about within-facility transfers. Alternatively, maybe the correct ADMISSION_LOCATION is 'TRANSFER' or 'TRANSFER IN'. Alternatively, perhaps the ADMISSION_TYPE is 'TRANSFER'. Let me check the schema again. The demographic table has ADMISSION_TYPE, which is a TEXT field. In the example data, it's 'EMERGENCY'. If the ADMISSION_TYPE for transfers is 'TRANSFER', then the condition would be WHERE ADMISSION_TYPE = 'TRANSFER' AND DISCHARGE_LOCATION = 'HOME'. But the user

QUESTION: how many of the unmarried patients belonged to white ethnic origin?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" = "SINGLE" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" = "WHITE"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user is asking for the number of unmarried patients who are of white ethnic origin. First, I need to identify the relevant table. The question mentions "unmarried patients" and "white ethnic origin," both of which are demographic details. So, the demographic table is the right place to look. Next, the columns involved. Marital status is in MARITAL_STATUS, and ethnicity is in ETHNICITY. The user wants a count of distinct patients, which means counting unique SUBJECT_IDs to avoid duplicates. The marital status "unmarried" could be represented in different ways, like 'SINGLE', 'DIVORCED', etc. But the user specified "unmarried," so maybe the exact term is 'SINGLE'? Wait, looking at the data preview, in the DEMOGRAPHIC table, there's a row with MARITAL_STATUS "SINGLE". But the user says "unmarried," which might include other statuses like 'DIVORCED' or 'WIDOWED'. However, the example given in the data uses "SEPARATED" and "SINGLE". The user might be considering 'SINGLE' as unmarried. But the problem is, the exact term isn't specified. However, the user instruction says when using diagnoses, use SHORT_TITLE exact term. But for demographic fields, maybe we should match exactly as per the data. Wait, the user's question says "unmarried", so perhaps the MARITAL_STATUS has a value 'UNMARRIED'? But in the data preview, the entries are "SEPARATED", "SINGLE", and an empty string. Hmm, maybe the data uses 'SINGLE' for unmarried. Or perhaps the possible values include 'SINGLE', 'MARRIED', etc. Since the example data shows "SINGLE" as a marital status, and the user is asking for unmarried, perhaps we should filter where MARITAL_STATUS is 'SINGLE'. But maybe there are other statuses considered unmarried. However, without knowing all possible values, it's safer to use the exact term provided by the user. Wait, the user's question is "unmarried patients", so maybe the MARITAL_STATUS field has a value that exactly matches 'UNMARRIED'? But in the data preview, the entries are "SEPARATED", "SINGLE", and an empty string. So perhaps the correct approach is to check for MARITAL_STATUS = 'SINGLE'? Or maybe the user considers 'SINGLE' as unmarried. Alternatively, maybe the data uses 'UNMARRIED' as a status. But given the data preview shows 'SINGLE', perhaps that's the correct value. Alternatively, maybe the user intended 'unmarried' to include multiple statuses, but without knowing the possible values, it's better to use the exact term. Wait, the user's instruction says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". But that's for the diagnoses table. For demographic fields, perhaps we should use exact matches as per the data. So if the data has 'SINGLE' as a marital status for unmarried patients, then the query should use MARITAL_STATUS = 'SINGLE'. But the user's question says "unmarried", which is a general term. However, in the absence of specific data values, perhaps the correct approach is to use the term 'UNMARRIED', but that might not exist. Alternatively, maybe the data uses 'SINGLE' to represent unmarried patients. Looking at the data preview example: the patient with SUBJECT_ID 10011 has MARITAL_STATUS 'SINGLE' and is 36 years old. So perhaps 'SINGLE' is the correct value to use here. Therefore, the condition would be MARITAL_STATUS = 'SINGLE'. For ethnicity, the user wants "white ethnic origin". In the data preview, the ETHNICITY column has values like "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" and "UNKNOWN/NOT SPECIFIED". So perhaps the correct value is 'WHITE' or something similar. But the exact term in the data might be 'WHITE' or 'CAUCASIAN'. The user's question says "white ethnic origin", so we need to match the ETHNICITY column to that. Looking at the data preview, one of the rows has ETHNICITY as "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN", another as "UNKNOWN/NOT SPECIFIED". So perhaps the correct value is 'WHITE' or 'CAUCASIAN'. But without seeing an example, it's a bit tricky. However, the user's instruction says to use exact terms as asked. So if the user says "white", we should look for ETHNICITY = 'WHITE'. But maybe the data uses a different term, like 'WHITE' or 'CAUCASIAN'. Assuming that the data has an entry where ETHNICITY is 'WHITE', then the condition would be ETHNICITY = 'WHITE'. Putting this together, the SQL query should select the count of distinct SUBJECT_ID from the demographic table where MARITAL_STATUS is 'SINGLE' and ETHNICITY is 'WHITE'. Wait, but in the data preview, the ETHNICITY for the first patient is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN", the second is "UNKNOWN/NOT SPECIFIED", and the third is also "UNKNOWN/NOT SPECIFIED". So maybe the actual data uses more specific terms. The user's question is about "white ethnic origin", so perhaps the ETHNICITY field has entries like 'WHITE' or 'EUROPEAN'. But without knowing, we have to go with the user's exact term. So the condition would be ETHNICITY = 'WHITE'. But wait, the user might have a typo or use a different casing. However, the instruction says to use LOWER() when matching strings. Wait, in the example provided, the user's query was for ICD9 code 9951, and the SQL uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". But for string matches, the example uses lowercase. Wait, in the example, the user's query was about ICD9 code 9951, which is a string, and the SQL uses = "9951". But in the data preview, the ICD9_CODE is stored as a string, e.g., "2761", "4280". So perhaps for exact matches, it's case-sensitive. However, the instruction says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()". Wait, in the job description, it says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". So for string comparisons, we should use LOWER() on both sides to make it case-insensitive. But in the example given, the SQL doesn't use LOWER(). Wait, the example output is: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" But ICD9_CODE is a string, and the value is "9951" in quotes. But according to the instruction, when matching strings, we should use LOWER(). However, in the example, they didn't. This is conflicting. Wait, the job description says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". But the example doesn't do that. Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect, or maybe the instruction is that for string matches, we should use LOWER() to make it case-insensitive. For example, if the user asks for a diagnosis with "Hyposmolality", and the data has "Hyposmolality", then it's a match. But if the data is in lowercase, or mixed case, using LOWER() would help. However, in the data preview, the SHORT_TITLE is "Hyposmolality" with capital H, so exact match is needed. But the instruction says to use exact term as asked. Wait, the instruction says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So for diagnoses, exact match on SHORT_TITLE. But for other tables, like demographic, perhaps we should also use exact matches. But the job description says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()". So perhaps for all string comparisons, we should use LOWER(column) = LOWER('value'). But in the example provided, the SQL doesn't do that. For example, the example query is looking for ICD9_CODE = "9951", which is a string comparison without lowercasing. But ICD9_CODE is a string, perhaps stored as a number, but in the data preview, it's stored with quotes, e.g., "2761", "4280". So maybe for codes, exact matches are okay, but for text fields like MARITAL_STATUS or ETHNICITY, we should use LOWER() to handle case insensitivity. So, for the current question, to find patients with ETHNICITY 'white', we should use LOWER(ETHNICITY) = 'white' to ensure case insensitivity. Similarly for MARITAL_STATUS, if the value is 'SINGLE' in the data, but the user says 'unmarried', perhaps the data doesn't have an 'unmarried' status, but 'SINGLE' is considered unmarried. However, the user's question is about 'unmarried' patients, which may not directly map to 'SINGLE

QUESTION: what number of patients have diagnosis short title as rec depr psych-psychotic and drug route as po/ng?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID INNER JOIN PRESCRIPTIONS on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PRESCRIPTIONS.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."SHORT_TITLE" = "Rec depr psych-psychotic" AND PRESCRIPTIONS."ROUTE" = "PO/NG"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the number of patients diagnosed with "Rec Depr Psych-Psychotic" and who have a prescription with the route "PO/NG". First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The diagnosis information is in the DIAGNOSES table, and prescriptions are in PRESCRIPTIONS. Since patients are involved, I should join these tables with DEMOGRAPHIC to count unique patients. Wait, but how are these tables connected? The DIAGNOSES and PRESCRIPTIONS both have SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. So joining DEMOGRAPHIC with DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID, then joining PRESCRIPTIONS on the same HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. That way, we ensure the diagnosis and prescription are from the same hospital admission. Next, the conditions: DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE should be exactly "Rec Depr Psych-Psychotic". The PRESCRIPTIONS.ROUTE should be "PO/NG". Also, need to count distinct SUBJECT_ID from DEMOGRAPHIC to avoid duplicates. Wait, the user said "diagnosis short title as rec depr psych-psychotic". Looking at the data preview, DIAGNOSES uses SHORT_TITLE exactly as stored. So the WHERE clause should check DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = 'Rec Depr Psych-Psychotic'. Similarly, PRESCRIPTIONS.ROUTE = 'PO/NG'. But wait, in the data preview, the prescriptions route is "PO" or "PR". The user wrote "PO/NG", maybe it's a typo or a specific value. Assuming the data has "PO/NG" as a possible route, so we'll use that. So the SQL would join DEMOGRAPHIC, DIAGNOSES, and PRESCRIPTIONS on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Then apply the two conditions. Finally, count distinct SUBJECT_ID from DEMOGRAPHIC. Wait, but do we need to join all three tables? Because DIAGNOSES and PRESCRIPTIONS both link to DEMOGRAPHIC via SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. So the patient must have both a diagnosis and a prescription in the same admission. So the joins would be DEMOGRAPHIC to DIAGNOSES on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID, then join PRESCRIPTIONS on the same keys. Yes. Then the WHERE clause filters the diagnosis and route. Then COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID) to get the number of unique patients. Let me check the example given. The example uses INNER JOIN and counts distinct SUBJECT_ID from DEMOGRAPHIC. So following that structure. So the final SQL should be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID") FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES ON DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID AND DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID = DIAGNOSES.SUBJECT_ID INNER JOIN PRESCRIPTIONS ON DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PRESCRIPTIONS.HADM_ID AND DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID = PRESCRIPTIONS.SUBJECT_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."SHORT_TITLE" = 'Rec Depr Psych-Psychotic' AND PRESCRIPTIONS."ROUTE" = 'PO/NG'; Wait, but in SQLite, string comparisons are case-sensitive by default. But the user mentioned to use LOWER() for string matches. Wait, in the job description, the example uses "ICD9_CODE" = "9951" without LOWER, but the instruction says when matching strings, match them lowercase with LOWER(). Wait, the example given by the user didn't use LOWER, but the instruction says to use LOWER(). Hmm, conflicting info. Looking back at the job description: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". But the example provided doesn't use LOWER. Maybe the example is incorrect. The instruction says to use LOWER() for string matches. So perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER(DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE) = 'rec depr psych-psychotic' and LOWER(PRESCRIPTIONS.ROUTE) = 'po/ng'. But the user's question says "diagnosis short title as rec depr psych-psychotic" which is the exact value. However, in the data preview, the SHORT_TITLE entries are like "Hyposmolality", "CHF NOS". So if the actual data has "Rec Depr Psych-Psychotic" with exact casing, then the query should match exactly. But the instruction says to use LOWER() for string matches. So perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER() on both sides. But the user's question might have a typo. For example, if the actual data has "Rec Depr Psych-Psychotic" with that exact casing, then the query should match exactly. But to make it case-insensitive, use LOWER. But according to the job description, the example uses "DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951"", which is a numeric code, so no LOWER needed. But for text fields, the instruction says to use LOWER(). So in this case, for SHORT_TITLE and ROUTE, which are text, we should use LOWER. So the WHERE clause should be: WHERE LOWER(DIAGNOSES."SHORT_TITLE") = 'rec depr psych-psychotic' AND LOWER(PRESCRIPTIONS."ROUTE") = 'po/ng' But the user wrote "PO/NG" in the question. If the actual data uses uppercase, like 'PO/NG', then LOWER would convert it to 'po/ng', which matches the condition. But if the data has 'po/ng', then the condition would still match. So using LOWER makes it case-insensitive. But the job description says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". Wait, in the schema notes: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user provides the exact term, we should match exactly without LOWER. For example, in the data preview, the SHORT_TITLE is "Hyposmolality", so if the user asks for that exact term, we match it as is. So in this case, the user's question says "diagnosis short title as rec depr psych-psychotic". Assuming that the exact SHORT_TITLE is "Rec Depr Psych-Psychotic" (with capitalization), but the user wrote it in lowercase. However, according to the instruction, we should use exact term as asked. Wait, the note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user provides the exact term, even if it's in lowercase, we should match it as is. But that might not be correct. Wait, the note might mean that when the user refers to a short title, we should use the exact string provided by the user, without modification. So if the user says "rec depr psych-psychotic", we should search for that exact string, which may not match if the data has it capitalized. But the note says to use exact term as asked. Hmm, this is confusing. Looking back at the data_preview for DIAGNOSES, the SHORT_TITLE entries are like "Hyposmolality", "CHF NOS". So they are in title case. If the user's query is in lowercase, but the actual data is in title case, then an exact match would fail. But according to the note, we should use the exact term as asked. Wait, the note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user provides "rec depr psych-psychotic", we should search for that exact string, which may not exist. But that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the note means that when the user refers to a short title, we should match the exact term in the database, so the user's input should be matched exactly as per the database's entries. But that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the note is instructing to use the SHORT_TITLE column for searching when the user asks about diagnoses, and to search by the exact term provided by the user. So if the user says "rec depr psych-psychotic", we should look for that exact string in SHORT_TITLE. But if the actual data has "Rec Depr Psych-Psychotic", then the case would not match, and the query would return zero. To avoid that, perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER() on both sides to make the match case-insensitive, even though the note says to use exact term. But the note might be emphasizing to use SHORT_TITLE instead of LONG_TITLE, not about case sensitivity. This is a bit ambiguous. Given the example provided in the job description, the user asked for "ICD9 9951" and the SQL uses "DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951"", which is exact. So perhaps for string fields, we should use exact matches as provided by the user, even if case differs. But that's risky. However, the instruction says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". The example didn't follow that, but the instruction says to do so. So perhaps the correct approach is to apply LOWER() to both the column and the value. In that case, the WHERE clause would be: WHERE L

QUESTION: provide me the number of black/haitian patients who were admitted before the year 2124.

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" = "BLACK/HAITIAN" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."ADMITYEAR" < "2124"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the number of Black/Haitian patients admitted before 2124. First, I need to identify the relevant table. The question is about patients' ethnicity and admission year, so the demographic table is the right place. The column for ethnicity is "ETHNICITY" in the demographic table. The user specified "black/haitian". Looking at the data preview, the example entry for ETHNICITY has "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". But the user might be referring to a broader category. Wait, the exact term in the data might vary. The example shows "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN", but maybe there's an entry like "BLACK/HAITIAN" in the actual data. However, since the user asked for "black/haitian", I should use the exact string match. But how is it stored? The data preview shows "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN", but perhaps "HAITIAN" is a separate category. The user might be combining both, but without knowing exact values, I should use the exact term provided by the user. Wait, the user wrote "black/haitian", so maybe the ETHNICITY field has entries like 'BLACK' or 'HAITIAN', or a combined term. But in the schema, the example data has "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". Hmm. The user might be using "black/haitian" as a way to refer to Black or Haitian ethnicity. So perhaps the ETHNICITY field includes 'BLACK' or 'HAITIAN' in some form. But in the data preview, the example is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". Maybe the actual data has more categories. Since the user's question is to count patients where ETHNICITY is "black/haitian", I need to match that exactly. Wait, but in the data preview, the example is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". So maybe the user's phrasing is different from the actual data. This could be a problem. Wait, the user instruction says: When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked. Wait, that note is under the DIAGNOSES table. So for diagnoses, use exact terms. But for demographic's ETHNICITY, perhaps the exact terms are as stored. Looking at the data preview, the example has "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" and "UNKNOWN/NOT SPECIFIED". So maybe the possible values for ETHNICITY include entries like 'BLACK/HAITIAN' or similar. But the user is asking for "black/haitian", so perhaps the exact value in the database is 'BLACK/HAITIAN'? Or maybe the user is using a shorthand. Alternatively, maybe the ETHNICITY field has 'BLACK' and 'HAITIAN' as separate entries. But without knowing the exact data, I have to go by the user's input. The user says "black/haitian", so I should use that as the exact string. But in the data preview, the example is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN", which is different. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the user made a typo, or the actual data has variations. Alternatively, perhaps the ETHNICITY field uses codes like 'BLACK' and 'HAITIAN' as separate entries. But the user's question combines them with a slash, which might indicate either/or. Wait, the user wrote "black/haitian", which could mean patients whose ethnicity is either Black or Haitian. So maybe the ETHNICITY field has values like 'BLACK' or 'HAITIAN', and we need to match either. But how are they stored? The example shows "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN", which is a single entry. So perhaps the possible values are more specific, and the user's terminology might not exactly match. But given the instructions, I should use the exact term provided by the user. However, the user's question says "black/haitian", which might be a way to refer to two separate categories. Alternatively, maybe in the data, 'Haitian' is part of the ethnicity description. But without knowing, perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER(ETHNICITY) to match case-insensitive and look for any occurrence of 'black' or 'haitian'. But the user instruction says to match exact terms as asked. Wait, the note under DIAGNOSES says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". But for other tables, like demographic, maybe it's similar. So perhaps for ETHNICITY, we should match the exact string as provided by the user. But the user wrote "black/haitian", which might not exist exactly in the data. For example, in the data preview, it's "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". So maybe the user's intended ethnicity is 'BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN' or another variation. Alternatively, perhaps the user is using 'black/haitian' as a combined term, but the actual data has separate entries. This is a potential ambiguity. However, given the instructions, I should proceed with the exact term provided by the user, assuming that the ETHNICITY field contains 'black/haitian' as a possible value. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to filter for any patient with 'black' or 'haitian' in their ethnicity. But the example in the data preview uses "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN", which includes 'BLACK' in the string. So perhaps the correct approach is to use ETHNICITY = 'BLACK/HAITIAN' if that's the exact value, but if the data has 'BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN', then the query would return zero. But the user might have a different data distribution. Since the user's question is to count patients with ethnicity 'black/haitian', I'll proceed with the exact match, using LOWER to make it case-insensitive. Wait, but the example in the data preview has "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" in uppercase. So perhaps the data stores ethnicity in uppercase. So to match 'black/haitian', we need to use LOWER(ETHNICITY) = 'black/haitian'? Or maybe the user's input is case-insensitive. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use ETHNICITY = 'BLACK/HAITIAN' if that's the exact value. But without knowing, perhaps the user's input is a typo, and the actual value is 'BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN' or another variation. This is a problem. But given the instructions, the user wants us to use exact terms as asked. So if the user says 'black/haitian', we should match that exactly. However, in the data preview, the example is 'BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN', which is different. So perhaps the user's question has a mistake, but we have to proceed with the given information. Alternatively, maybe 'Haitian' is a separate category. For example, maybe there's an ethnicity entry like 'HAITIAN'. In that case, the user might want to count patients where ETHNICITY is either 'BLACK' or 'HAITIAN'. But the user wrote 'black/haitian', which could be a slash indicating either/or. So perhaps the correct approach is to check if ETHNICITY is in ('BLACK', 'HAITIAN'). But again, without knowing the actual possible values, it's hard. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to use LOWER(ETHNICITY) = 'black/haitian', but that might not match any entries. Alternatively, the user might have intended to search for patients whose ethnicity includes either 'Black' or 'Haitian', so using a LIKE operator. For example, ETHNICITY LIKE '%BLACK%' OR ETHNICITY LIKE '%HAITIAN%'. But the instructions say to use exact terms as asked. Wait, the note under DIAGNOSES says to use exact terms, but that's for SHORT_TITLE. For other tables, perhaps it's similar. The user's question is about demographic, so maybe we should use the exact term provided. But given the data preview's example, it's possible that the exact term 'black/haitian' doesn't exist. This is a challenge. However, the user's instruction says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". That note is under the DIAGNOSES table, so maybe for other tables, we should use the exact term as provided by the user. So in this case, the user says "black/haitian", so we should match ETHNICITY exactly to that string. But since in the data preview, the example is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN", which is different, perhaps the user's data has other entries. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, but we have to proceed as per the question. So the SQL would be SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID) FROM demographic WHERE ETHNICITY = 'black/haitian' AND ADMITYEAR < 2124. But wait, the data preview shows ADMITYEAR as 2164, 2126, etc. The user wants patients admitted before 2124. So ADMITYEAR < 2124. Also, the column is ADMITYEAR in demographic. So the WHERE clause should have ETHNICITY = 'black/haitian' and ADMITYEAR <

QUESTION: how many patients belonging to black/haitian ethnic background hav ethe procedure icd9 code 8854?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PROCEDURES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PROCEDURES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" = "BLACK/HAITIAN" AND PROCEDURES."ICD9_CODE" = "8854"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user is asking how many patients from a Black or Haitian ethnic background have undergone a procedure with ICD9 code 8854. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The demographic table has ethnicity information, and the procedures table has ICD9 codes for procedures. Since we're counting patients, we'll need to join these tables on HADM_ID or SUBJECT_ID. Wait, in the schema, both tables have SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. But procedures are linked to hospital admissions, so joining on HADM_ID makes sense here. However, looking at the data preview, procedures have HADM_ID, and demographic also has HADM_ID. So joining on HADM_ID would link the procedure to the admission, which is correct. Next, the ethnicity condition. The user specified "black/haitian". In the demographic data preview, one entry has "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" as ethnicity. So the ethnicity field might have variations. The exact term here is probably "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" or "HAITIAN". But the user wrote "black/haitian", so maybe the ethnicity in the database is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" or "HAITIAN". To cover both, we can use an OR condition. But since SQLite is case-insensitive for LIKE, but the data is stored in uppercase, maybe using LOWER() to match. Alternatively, exact match with IN. Wait, the user's instruction says when matching strings, use LOWER(). So perhaps the ethnicity is stored in uppercase, so we should convert it to lowercase and check if it's 'black/haitian'? Wait, the user's example shows using quotes around the value, but in the data preview, the ethnicity is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". So the actual value might be "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" or "HAITIAN". The user's question says "black/haitian", which might correspond to "BLACK/HAITIAN" in the data. But looking at the data preview, the example has "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". So maybe the exact term is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" or another variation. Alternatively, perhaps the ethnicity field has entries like 'BLACK' or 'HAITIAN'. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. The user's instruction says to use exact terms as asked, but in the data preview, the example uses "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". So perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") IN ('black', 'haitian')? Or maybe the ethnicity is stored as a single string that includes both, like 'BLACK/HAITIAN'. Alternatively, maybe the user's term is a typo, and they meant 'Black or Haitian', so the ethnicity could be either 'BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN' or 'HAITIAN'. But without knowing the exact possible values, perhaps using LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") LIKE '%black%' OR LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") LIKE '%haitian%'. However, the user's instruction says when asked to use exact terms, but in this case, the user's question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the exact value is 'BLACK/HAITIAN' in the database. But in the data preview, the example has "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". So perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") = 'black/haitian'? But the user wrote "black/haitian ethnic background", which might be referring to two separate groups: Black and Haitian. So maybe the ethnicity field has entries like 'BLACK' or 'HAITIAN', and we need to check for either. But in the data preview, the example has "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN", so perhaps the exact term is that. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to group these together, so using a LIKE to capture any ethnicity containing 'black' or 'haitian'. But the user's instruction says to use exact terms as asked. Wait, in the schema's data_preview section, the user provided an example where ETHNICITY is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". So perhaps the correct approach is to match exactly on that string. But the user's question says "black/haitian". Hmm. Maybe the user made a typo, and the actual ethnicity is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" or "HAITIAN". So the condition would be DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" IN ('BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN', 'HAITIAN'). But how to know? Alternatively, perhaps the user's intended ethnicity is 'Black' or 'Haitian', and the data uses 'BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN' for Black. So maybe the correct approach is to check if ETHNICITY is either 'BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN' or 'HAITIAN'. But without knowing all possible values, this is a bit tricky. The user's instruction says to use exact terms as asked, but in the data preview, the example uses "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". So perhaps the user's question is referring to that exact term, but they wrote "black/haitian". Alternatively, maybe the user intended to include any ethnicity that includes 'Black' or 'Haitian', so using LOWER() to capture variations. For example, LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") LIKE '%black%' OR LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") LIKE '%haitian%'. But the user's example in the data_preview shows that when the question was about ICD9 code 9951, the SQL uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". So exact match. Therefore, perhaps the ethnicity should be matched exactly. But the problem is that the user's question says "black/haitian", but the data has "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". So maybe the user made a mistake, but we have to go with what's in the data. Alternatively, perhaps the ethnicity in the database is stored as 'BLACK/HAITIAN' in some cases. But without more data, it's hard to tell. Given the example in the data_preview, the correct approach is to use the exact value as in the data. So if the user's intended ethnicity is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN" or "HAITIAN", then the condition would be DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" IN ('BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN', 'HAITIAN'). But the user wrote "black/haitian", which might be a typo for "BLACK/HAITIAN", but that's not present in the data preview. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to group Black and Haitian ethnicities, which in the database are separate entries. But given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to use LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") IN ('black/haitian', 'black', 'haitian') or similar. But the example in the data_preview shows that the ethnicity is "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN", so maybe the correct value is that. Therefore, the condition should be DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" = 'BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN' OR DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" = 'HAITIAN'. But how to represent that in SQL. Alternatively, using IN clause. So DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" IN ('BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN', 'HAITIAN'). But the user's question says "black/haitian", which might be a single term, but in the data, it's "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN". So perhaps the user's intended ethnicity is 'BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN', and 'Haitian' is another possible value. But without knowing, perhaps the safest way is to use LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") LIKE '%black%' OR LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY") LIKE '%haitian%'. However, the user's instruction says to use exact terms as asked. Wait, in the [data_preview] section for diagnoses, the user mentioned that when asked, use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked. So perhaps for ethnicity, the same applies: exact match. But the user's question uses "black/haitian", which may not exactly match any entry. Given the data preview has "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN", perhaps the correct approach is to match that exact string. But the user's question includes "haitian", which isn't in the example. This is a bit of a problem. Maybe the user intended to include both Black and Haitian ethnicities, so the condition should check for either. But how? If the database has 'BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN' and 'HAITIAN' as separate ethnicities, then the condition would be DEMOGRAPHIC."ETHNICITY" IN ('BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN', 'HAITIAN'). But since the user wrote "black/haitian", perhaps they meant either. So proceeding with that. Next, the procedure ICD9 code is 8854. The procedures table has ICD9_CODE as an integer in the schema, but in the data preview, it's a string, e

QUESTION: Specify the total number of patients who had suture bladder lacerat and a death status of unspecified

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PROCEDURES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PROCEDURES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."EXPIRE_FLAG" = "0" AND PROCEDURES."SHORT_TITLE" = "Suture bladder lacerat"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the total number of patients who had "suture bladder lacerat" and a death status of "unspecified". First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The "suture bladder lacerat" sounds like a diagnosis, so the DIAGNOSES table is involved. The death status is probably in the DEMOGRAPHIC table, maybe the EXPIRE_FLAG or another column. Wait, the schema shows DEMOGRAPHIC has EXPIRE_FLAG, which is an integer. But the user mentioned "death status of unspecified". Hmm, maybe EXPIRE_FLAG indicates if the patient died (1) or not (0), but "unspecified" might not be directly there. Wait, looking at the data preview for DEMOGRAPHIC, there's a column "DISCHARGE_LOCATION" with values like "DEAD/EXPIRED". But the user's question says "death status of unspecified". Maybe the actual column is something else. Let me check the schema again. Looking at the DEMOGRAPHIC table, the columns are: EXPIRE_FLAG (integer), and other location columns. Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the "DISCHARGE_LOCATION" as the death status. For example, in the data preview, one patient has DISCHARGE_LOCATION as "DEAD/EXPIRED". If "unspecified" is a possible value there, then that's the column to use. Alternatively, maybe the "ETHNICITY" or another column, but that seems less likely. The user's question says "death status", so DISCHARGE_LOCATION might not be the right field. Wait, maybe the EXPIRE_FLAG is 0 or 1, and "unspecified" isn't captured here. This is a bit confusing. Wait, the user's question says "death status of unspecified". If EXPIRE_FLAG is 0 or 1, maybe "unspecified" isn't directly represented. Alternatively, perhaps there's another column. Let me check the schema again. The DEMOGRAPHIC table has "EXPIRE_FLAG" (0 or 1), "ADMISSION_LOCATION", "DISCHARGE_LOCATION", etc. Maybe the "DISCHARGE_LOCATION" has values like 'HOME', 'DEAD', etc., and 'unspecified' is one of them. Looking at the data preview, one row has DISCHARGE_LOCATION as "HOME HEALTH CARE", another as "DEAD/EXPIRED". So perhaps "unspecified" is a possible value in DISCHARGE_LOCATION. But the user's question is about "death status", which might be separate. Alternatively, maybe the "ETHNICITY" or "RELIGION" fields, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and meant "EXPIRE_FLAG" being unspecified, but that's an integer (0 or 1). Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. But given the data preview, the DISCHARGE_LOCATION has "DEAD/EXPIRED" and others. If "unspecified" is a possible value there, then we can use that. Alternatively, maybe the "DOD" (date of death) is null for patients who didn't die, but the EXPIRE_FLAG would indicate that. But the user's question is about "death status of unspecified", which might mean that the death status isn't specified, i.e., maybe EXPIRE_FLAG is 0 (not expired) but the discharge location isn't recorded as dead. But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the "EXPIRE_FLAG" being unspecified, but since it's an integer (0 or 1), maybe "unspecified" isn't a valid value. This is a problem. Maybe the user intended "EXPIRE_FLAG = 0" (not expired) but that's not "unspecified". Alternatively, maybe there's a column in DEMOGRAPHIC that I'm missing. Let me check the schema again. The DEMOGRAPHIC table has columns: SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, NAME, MARITAL_STATUS, AGE, DOB, GENDER, LANGUAGE, RELIGION, ADMISSION_TYPE, DAYS_STAY, INSURANCE, ETHNICITY, EXPIRE_FLAG, ADMISSION_LOCATION, DISCHARGE_LOCATION, DIAGNOSIS, DOD, DOB_YEAR, DOD_YEAR, ADMITTIME, DISCHTIME, ADMITYEAR. So, the EXPIRE_FLAG is 0 or 1. The DISCHARGE_LOCATION has values like "HOME HEALTH CARE", "DEAD/EXPIRED", etc. The user's question is about "death status of unspecified". If "unspecified" is a value in DISCHARGE_LOCATION, then we can filter where DISCHARGE_LOCATION = 'UNSPECIFIED' or similar. But in the data preview, the DISCHARGE_LOCATION has "DEAD/EXPIRED" and "HOME HEALTH CARE". So perhaps the user's "unspecified" refers to a different column. Alternatively, maybe the "ETHNICITY" or "RELIGION" has an 'unspecified' value, but that's unrelated to death status. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the EXPIRE_FLAG being 0 (not expired) but the discharge location is unspecified. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the "DOD" (date of death) is null, which would mean the patient hasn't died, but again, that's EXPIRE_FLAG = 0. This is a bit of a problem. The user's question might have a mistake, but I need to proceed with the information given. Let's assume that "death status of unspecified" refers to the EXPIRE_FLAG being 0 (not expired) or another column. Alternatively, maybe the "DISCHARGE_LOCATION" is 'UNSPECIFIED'. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant that the death status is not recorded, which would be EXPIRE_FLAG is 0 and DISCHARGE_LOCATION not being 'DEAD/EXPIRED'. But that's speculative. Given the ambiguity, but based on the data preview, the DISCHARGE_LOCATION has 'DEAD/EXPIRED' for patients who died. So perhaps "unspecified" is a different value in DISCHARGE_LOCATION. But without seeing all possible values, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe the user intended "EXPIRE_FLAG = 0" (not expired) as "unspecified" death status. But that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the "ETHNICITY" column has 'unspecified', but that's unrelated. Wait, the user's question says "death status of unspecified". The most logical way to interpret this is that the patient's death status is not specified, meaning perhaps that the EXPIRE_FLAG is 0 (not expired) and there's no DOD recorded. But how to represent that. Alternatively, maybe the "DISCHARGE_LOCATION" is 'UNSPECIFIED' or similar. Given the ambiguity, but based on the schema and data preview, the best approach is to join DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES tables. The DIAGNOSES table has SHORT_TITLE, which for "suture bladder lacerat" would be the condition. Then, in DEMOGRAPHIC, we need to filter for death status 'unspecified'. Assuming that "unspecified" in death status refers to the DISCHARGE_LOCATION being 'UNSPECIFIED' or a similar value. But in the data preview, the DISCHARGE_LOCATION is 'DEAD/EXPIRED' or 'HOME HEALTH CARE'. So perhaps the user made a typo, and meant 'unspecified' in another column. Alternatively, maybe the EXPIRE_FLAG is 0, which means the patient did not expire, but that's not 'unspecified'—it's 'alive'. This is a problem. The user's question might have a mistake, but I need to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the "death status" is a column that's not present, and the user is referring to the EXPIRE_FLAG. But in that case, 'unspecified' would not be a valid value. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to refer to the "DISCHARGE_LOCATION" being 'UNSPECIFIED', which would be a possible value. Given that, the SQL would involve joining DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID, filtering DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = 'suture bladder lacerat' and DEMOGRAPHIC.DISCHARGE_LOCATION = 'UNSPECIFIED'. But in the data preview, the DISCHARGE_LOCATION has 'DEAD/EXPIRED' and 'HOME HEALTH CARE', so 'UNSPECIFIED' might be another possible value. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the death status is not recorded, which would be EXPIRE_FLAG = 0. But that's not 'unspecified'—it's 'alive'. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the 'ETHNICITY' being 'unspecified', but that's unrelated. This is a bit of a challenge. Given the ambiguity, but proceeding with the assumption that "death status of unspecified" refers to the DISCHARGE_LOCATION being 'UNSPECIFIED' or a similar value.

LLM [deepseek-r1]: and return only the query. Also, the example didn't use LOWER() for the ICD9_CODE, which is a string but treated as a code.

Wait, the schema note says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user provides the exact term, we should match it exactly, case-sensitive. But that contradicts the job description's instruction to use LOWER(). Hmm, this is conflicting. Let me recheck the schema notes: In the schema section, under diagnoses, it says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user provides the exact term, we should match it exactly, without lowercasing. For example, if the data has "CHF NOS" and the user asks for "CHF NOS", then exact match. But if the user writes "chf nos", then it would not match unless we use LOWER. But according to the schema note, we should search by exact term as asked. So the instruction is to use exact match on SHORT_TITLE as provided by the user, case-sensitive. Therefore, in this case, the user's query is "acute on chronic systolic heart failure", so we should match SHORT_TITLE exactly to that string, case-sensitive. But in the data_preview, the SHORT_TITLEs are in title case, like "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". So if the user's term is in lowercase, it might not match. However, the schema note says to use exact term as asked. So if the user's question has the exact term as it appears in the data, then it's correct. Otherwise, it might not find anything. But the user is asking to find patients diagnosed with that exact term, so we have to assume that the SHORT_TITLE in the database matches exactly. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the exact string provided in the query without lowercasing. So the WHERE clause would be: DIAGNOSES."SHORT_TITLE" = 'acute on chronic systolic heart failure' But wait, in the data_preview example, the SHORT_TITLE is "Hyposmolality", which is title case. If the user's query is in lowercase, the exact match would fail. But according to the schema note, we should search by exact term as asked. So perhaps the user is expected to provide the exact term as it exists in the database. But in this case, the user's question is to find "acute on chronic systolic heart failure", and we have to assume that the SHORT_TITLE in the database is exactly that. So the SQL should use the exact string. Therefore, the final query is: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID") FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES ON DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."INSURANCE" = 'Medicaid' AND DIAGNOSES."SHORT_TITLE" = 'acute on chronic systolic heart failure'; But wait, the example in

QUESTION: how many male patients have copd exacerbation as their primary disease?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."GENDER" = "M" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS" = "COPD EXACERBATION"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants to know how many male patients have COPD exacerbation as their primary disease. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The demographic table has patient information, including gender. The diagnoses table contains the primary disease, which is probably indicated by the DIAGNOSIS field in the demographic table. Wait, looking at the schema, the demographic table has a DIAGNOSIS column. The user mentioned "primary disease," so that's likely stored there. Wait, but the diagnoses table has SHORT_TITLE and LONG_TITLE. However, the user's example shows that when a diagnosis is asked, they join with the diagnoses table. But in the data preview, the demographic table has a DIAGNOSIS field. Hmm, maybe the primary diagnosis is in the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS column. Let me check the schema again. The demographic table's DIAGNOSIS is a TEXT field. The example given in the data_preview shows a DIAGNOSIS like "SEPSIS" in the demographic table. So if the primary disease is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, then we don't need to join with the diagnoses table. But the user's example earlier used the diagnoses table for ICD9 codes. Wait, the question here is about "copd exacerbation" as the primary disease. The DIAGNOSIS field in demographic might have the primary diagnosis. So maybe we can just filter on demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But wait, the diagnoses table has SHORT_TITLE, which in the data preview example has entries like "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". The user instruction says when asked to use diagnoses, use the SHORT_TITLE for exact matches. However, the question here is about the primary disease. The demographic table's DIAGNOSIS might be the primary diagnosis upon admission. So perhaps the primary disease is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, and other diagnoses are in the diagnoses table. So if the user is asking for primary disease, we should look at demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But the example given in the job description was for a diagnosis using the diagnoses table. Let me check the example again. The example query was for ICD9 code 9951, which is in the diagnoses table. So for specific diagnoses codes or titles, the diagnoses table is used, but the primary diagnosis might be in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. The user's question here is about "copd exacerbation as their primary disease", which would be the main diagnosis upon admission, so that's probably in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. Wait, but the data_preview shows that the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is "SEPSIS" for one patient. So if the primary diagnosis is there, then the query would select from demographic where DIAGNOSIS is 'COPD EXACERBATION' and GENDER is 'Male'. Then count distinct SUBJECT_ID. But the user might be confused between the two tables. Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is the first entry in the diagnoses table for a HADM_ID. But the schema doesn't indicate that. The problem is that the question is ambiguous. However, the user's example uses the diagnoses table for a specific ICD9 code. But in this case, the user is asking about the primary disease, which might be in the demographic's DIAGNOSIS field. Alternatively, perhaps the primary diagnosis is the one listed in the demographic table, and other diagnoses are secondary. So to find patients with COPD exacerbation as their primary disease, we need to look at demographic.DIAGNOSIS. Then, filter for male patients. So the SQL would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT demographic.SUBJECT_ID) FROM demographic WHERE demographic.DIAGNOSIS = 'COPD EXACERBATION' AND demographic.GENDER = 'Male' But wait, the user's example in the job description used the diagnoses table. Let me check the example again. The example was for ICD9 code 9951, which is in the diagnoses table. So when the question is about a diagnosis, it's in the diagnoses table, but when it's about the primary diagnosis, it's in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But the user's question here is about "primary disease", which is likely the DIAGNOSIS in demographic. So the correct approach is to use the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS field. However, the data preview shows that the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is like "SEPSIS", while the diagnoses table's SHORT_TITLE has entries like "Hyposmolality". So if "COPD exacerbation" is a SHORT_TITLE in the diagnoses table, then perhaps the primary disease is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, but other diagnoses (including COPD exacerbation) are in the diagnoses table. But the user is asking for primary disease, so we should check demographic.DIAGNOSIS. Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is the first entry in the diagnoses table for a patient's HADM_ID. But the schema doesn't specify that. This is a bit ambiguous. However, given the user's example, when they asked about a diagnosis, they joined with the diagnoses table. But in this case, the question specifies "primary disease", which might be in the demographic table. Alternatively, perhaps the primary diagnosis is the one listed in the demographic table, and the diagnoses table includes all secondary diagnoses. So to answer the question, we need to check the demographic's DIAGNOSIS field for 'COPD EXACERBATION' and the GENDER as 'Male'. But to confirm, looking at the data_preview for demographic, the DIAGNOSIS is "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B", etc. So if the user's question is about the primary diagnosis, that's where it would be. Therefore, the correct approach is to query the demographic table, filter where DIAGNOSIS is 'COPD EXACERBATION' and GENDER is 'Male', then count distinct SUBJECT_ID. But wait, the user might have intended that COPD exacerbation is a diagnosis in the diagnoses table, and the primary disease is indicated by some flag. However, the schema doesn't show any such flag. So perhaps the primary disease is in the demographic's DIAGNOSIS, and other diagnoses are in the diagnoses table. Therefore, the correct SQL is: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT demographic."SUBJECT_ID") FROM demographic WHERE demographic."DIAGNOSIS" = 'COPD EXACERBATION' AND demographic."GENDER" = 'Male' But I need to make sure that the DIAGNOSIS field in demographic is the correct place. Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is the first entry in the diagnoses table for a HADM_ID. But without a flag indicating primary, it's hard to tell. However, the user's example used the diagnoses table for a specific ICD9 code, which suggests that when the question is about a diagnosis, regardless of primary or secondary, the diagnoses table is used. But the question here specifies "primary disease", which might be in the demographic's DIAGNOSIS. Alternatively, perhaps the primary diagnosis is the one listed in the demographic table, and the rest are secondary. So the answer would be as above. But to be safe, perhaps the user intended to use the diagnoses table's SHORT_TITLE. For example, if "COPD exacerbation" is a SHORT_TITLE in the diagnoses table, then the query would join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID, filter where SHORT_TITLE is 'COPD EXACERBATION' and GENDER is 'Male', then count distinct SUBJECT_ID. But the user's question specifies "primary disease", which might imply that it's the main diagnosis, possibly in the demographic table. However, without explicit information, this is ambiguous. The example provided in the job description uses the diagnoses table for a specific ICD9 code, which is part of the diagnoses table. But the user's question here is about the primary disease, which might be in the demographic's DIAGNOSIS. Given the ambiguity, but considering the example, perhaps the user expects to use the diagnoses table. Wait, the example in the job description was for a diagnosis code, which is in the diagnoses table. The current question is about a diagnosis (COPD exacerbation) which could be a SHORT_TITLE in the diagnoses table. However, the user specifies "primary disease", which might be the main diagnosis in the demographic table. Alternatively, perhaps the primary diagnosis is the one listed in the demographic's DIAGNOSIS, and other diagnoses are in the diagnoses table. So to find patients with COPD exacerbation as their primary disease, we check the demographic's DIAGNOSIS. But if the user intended to use the diagnoses table's SHORT_TITLE, then we need to join. This is a critical point. Let me check the data_preview again. In the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS, the examples are "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B", "SEPSIS". In the diagnoses table's SHORT_TITLE, examples are "Hyposmolality", "CHF NOS", etc. So "COPD exacerbation" might be a SHORT_TITLE in the diagnoses table. But if the primary disease is in the demographic's DIAGNOSIS, then the query should be on demographic. However, if the primary disease is considered as one of the diagnoses in the diagnoses table, perhaps with a specific code or title, then a join is needed. The user's question is ambiguous. However, given that the example in the job description used the diagnoses table for a specific code, and the current question is about a diagnosis (COPD exacerbation), which could be a SHORT_TITLE, perhaps the

QUESTION: count the number of patients who left the hospital against medical advice.

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."DISCHARGE_LOCATION" = "LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVI"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to count the number of patients who left the hospital against medical advice. First, I need to identify which table contains information about discharge locations. Looking at the schema, the DEMOGRAPHIC table has a column called DISCHARGE_LOCATION. That's where the discharge status would be stored. The question mentions "left against medical advice." In hospital terms, this is often abbreviated as "AMA" (Against Medical Advice). So the DISCHARGE_LOCATION entries might have values like 'AMA' or similar. But I should check the data preview to confirm. Looking at the data preview for DEMOGRAPHIC, the sample DISCHARGE_LOCATION entries are "HOME HEALTH CARE" and "DEAD/EXPIRED". Hmm, maybe the actual term used is different. Maybe it's 'LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' or another exact phrase. Since the user said "against medical advice," I need to match the exact term in DISCHARGE_LOCATION. The user wants the count of distinct patients, not admissions. So I should count DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID from DEMOGRAPHIC where DISCHARGE_LOCATION matches the specific term. But how is that term represented in the data? The example data doesn't show it, but perhaps the value is 'LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' or similar. Assuming that the DISCHARGE_LOCATION has an entry like 'AGAINST ADVICE' or 'LEFT AMA', but since the user's question uses the exact phrase "left the hospital against medical advice", maybe the exact value in the table is 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' or similar. To be safe, I'll use LOWER(DISCHARGE_LOCATION) to make the comparison case-insensitive and check for any variation that includes 'against medical advice'. Wait, but the user might expect an exact match. Let me think. The data preview shows entries like "HOME HEALTH CARE" and "DEAD/EXPIRED". So the exact term for leaving against medical advice might be 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' or 'LEFT AMA'. But without seeing the actual data, I have to rely on the user's question. The user said "left the hospital against medical advice", so the DISCHARGE_LOCATION should have a value that exactly matches that scenario. In SQLite, string comparisons are case-sensitive by default. To ensure we capture any case variations, using LOWER() on DISCHARGE_LOCATION and comparing to 'against medical advice' in lowercase would help. But maybe the exact value is 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' in uppercase. However, the user's instruction says to use exact terms as asked. Wait, the data_preview section for DIAGNOSES says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So perhaps for DISCHARGE_LOCATION, the exact term is expected. But the user's question uses "left the hospital against medical advice", which might correspond to a specific DISCHARGE_LOCATION value like 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' or 'LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE'. Alternatively, maybe the discharge location has a code or a specific term. Since the example in the data_preview for DEMOGRAPHIC shows "DISCHARGE_LOCATION" as "HOME HEALTH CARE" and "DEAD/EXPIRED", perhaps the exact value is 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' or similar. To match exactly, perhaps the value is 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' in the database. But since the user's question uses the phrase "left the hospital against medical advice", maybe the exact term in the database is 'LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE'. However, without seeing the actual data, it's a bit tricky. But according to the job description, when the user asks for a term, we should use exact matches. For example, in the diagnoses table, the user would search by the exact SHORT_TITLE. So perhaps here, the DISCHARGE_LOCATION has an exact value that matches the user's phrasing. The user's question is "left the hospital against medical advice", so the corresponding value in DISCHARGE_LOCATION might be 'LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' or similar. But to be safe, perhaps using a LIKE clause with '%against medical advice%' would capture variations. However, SQLite's LIKE is case-insensitive only if the column is defined with a collation, which we don't know. So to be safe, using LOWER(DISCHARGE_LOCATION) = 'against medical advice' or similar. Wait, but the example given in the job description for ICD9 code 9951 uses an exact match: DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". So perhaps exact matches are expected here. Therefore, if the DISCHARGE_LOCATION has an exact value like 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE', the query should use that exact string. But how do I know the exact string in the database? The data preview for DEMOGRAPHIC shows "DISCHARGE_LOCATION" as "HOME HEALTH CARE" and "DEAD/EXPIRED". So perhaps the exact term for leaving against medical advice is 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' or 'LEFT AMA'. But the user's question uses the phrase "left the hospital against medical advice", which might correspond to a specific term in the database. Since the example in the data_preview for DIAGNOSES uses exact SHORT_TITLE matches, I should use an exact match here as well. Alternatively, maybe the DISCHARGE_LOCATION entry is 'HOSPICE' or other terms, but the user is specifically asking about leaving against advice. So the correct approach is to filter DEMOGRAPHIC where DISCHARGE_LOCATION equals the exact term that represents leaving against medical advice. Since the data preview doesn't show this, I have to assume that the value is exactly 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' or similar. But the user's question uses the phrase "left the hospital against medical advice", which might be the exact value in the database. So the SQL would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID") FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."DISCHARGE_LOCATION" = 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' But how to confirm the exact string? Since the user's instruction says to use exact terms as asked, but the data_preview for DIAGNOSES says to use SHORT_TITLE to search by exact term as asked. So perhaps for DISCHARGE_LOCATION, the exact term is 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE', but the user's question uses "left the hospital against medical advice", which might not be the exact term. This is a problem. Wait, the user's question is in natural language, so the model needs to map that to the exact value in the database. For example, if the database uses 'LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' as the DISCHARGE_LOCATION, then the query should match that. But without knowing the exact value, the model has to make an educated guess based on common terminology. In healthcare, the common term for this is 'Against Medical Advice' (AMA). So the DISCHARGE_LOCATION might be 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' or 'LEFT AMA'. To cover possible variations, perhaps using a LIKE with '%AGAINST%ADVICE%' but SQLite is case-sensitive. Alternatively, using LOWER(DISCHARGE_LOCATION) = 'against medical advice' would handle case variations. But the example in the job description uses an exact match without lowercasing. For instance, the example query uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", which is exact. So perhaps the model should use an exact match here. But the problem is that the user's question might not use the exact term as stored in the database. Alternatively, perhaps the DISCHARGE_LOCATION has a value like 'LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE', so the exact string would be that. But the user's question says "left the hospital against medical advice", which is slightly different. However, in the context of the database, the exact term might be 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' without the 'left the hospital' part. So the model needs to map the user's intent to the correct database value. Given that the example in the data_preview for DIAGNOSES uses exact SHORT_TITLE matches, the model should use an exact match here. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the exact term as per the database. But since the user's question is in natural language, the model must infer the correct term. In many healthcare databases, the discharge location for patients leaving against medical advice is coded as 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' or 'AMA'. Assuming that the database uses 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE', the WHERE clause would be: WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."DISCHARGE_LOCATION" = 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' But to confirm, looking at the data_preview for DEMOGRAPHIC, the sample DISCHARGE_LOCATION entries are "HOME HEALTH CARE" and "DEAD/EXPIRED". So the exact term for against medical advice might be different. However, without more data, the best approach is to use the exact term that matches the user's question, adjusted to the database's likely terminology. Another angle: the user wants patients who left against medical advice. In the DEMOGRAPHIC table, the DISCHARGE_LOCATION column holds where the patient was discharged to. Leaving against medical advice would mean the discharge location is 'AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE' or similar. Therefore, the SQL query should select COUNT(DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID

LLM [deepseek-r1]: ". So perhaps the user expects us to use double quotes as in the example, even if it's technically incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the example is a typo, and the correct is single quotes. But given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest way is to use single quotes for string literals, as per SQL standards, even if the example uses double. Because otherwise, the query might not run correctly in SQLite. Wait, the user specified: "Assume SQLITE database, be careful not to use functions not available there". So in SQLite, string literals should be in single quotes. Using double quotes would be treated as identifiers, which would cause an error if the identifier doesn't exist. So the example's use of double quotes is incorrect. Therefore, the correct approach is to use single quotes. So in the query, for the SHORT_TITLE comparison, it should be LOWER(DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE) = 'closed fracture of surgical neck of humerus', and similarly for ROUTE = 'iv'. Therefore, the corrected SQL would use single quotes. So the final query would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID") FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES ON DEMOGRAPHIC."HADM_ID" = DIAGNOSES."HADM_ID" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" = DIAGNOSES."SUBJECT_ID" INNER JOIN PRESCRIPTIONS ON DEMOGRAPHIC."HADM_ID" = PRESCRIPTIONS."HADM_ID" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" = PRESCRIPTIONS."SUBJECT_ID" WHERE LOWER(DIAGNOSES."SHORT_TITLE") = 'closed fracture of surgical neck of humerus' AND LOWER(PRESCRIPTIONS."ROUTE") = 'iv'; Also, the user mentioned to prefix columns with TABLE_NAME and wrap in quotes. So all columns are properly quoted with table names. Yes, that should do it. The joins are on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID to ensure that the diagnosis and prescription are from the same admission. The LOWER() function is used to make the comparison case-insensitive, and single quotes for string literals as per SQLite standards. </think>

QUESTION: let me know both the short title and icd9 code of procedure of patient thomas nazario.

TRUE: SELECT PROCEDURES."ICD9_CODE",PROCEDURES."SHORT_TITLE" FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PROCEDURES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PROCEDURES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."NAME" = "Thomas Nazario"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants both the short title and ICD9 code of the procedure for a patient named Thomas Nazario. First, I need to identify which tables are involved. The patient's name is in the demographic table, and procedures are in the procedures table. So I'll need to join these two tables. The key is to link them on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. Wait, both tables have SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. But to get the correct procedures for Thomas, I should join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID to ensure it's the same patient's admission. But maybe just HADM_ID is enough? Wait, in the schema, demographic has HADM_ID as a foreign key to diagnoses and other tables. So joining on HADM_ID between demographic and procedures should work. Wait, but in the demographic table, each row is a patient's admission, right? So each HADM_ID is unique to an admission. So procedures are linked to an admission via HADM_ID. So joining demographic and procedures on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID would be more accurate, but maybe just HADM_ID is sufficient. Wait, looking at the data preview, for example, in demographic, SUBJECT_ID 10006 has HADM_ID 142345. In procedures, SUBJECT_ID 10056 has HADM_ID 100375. So each procedure is linked to a specific admission (HADM_ID) and patient (SUBJECT_ID). So to correctly join, we need to match both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID? Or maybe HADM_ID is unique across the database, so joining on HADM_ID alone would suffice. Hmm, but HADM_ID is unique per admission, so each HADM_ID in demographic corresponds to one admission. Procedures are per admission, so each procedure's HADM_ID would match the demographic's HADM_ID. So joining on HADM_ID should be enough. But maybe to be safe, join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Because a patient can have multiple admissions (different HADM_IDs), so to ensure that the procedure is for the same patient and same admission, joining on both would be better. But looking at the example given in the job description: the example joins DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID. So maybe in this database, HADM_ID is sufficient to join across tables. So perhaps the same applies here. So joining demographic and procedures on HADM_ID. But the patient's name is in demographic, so we need to filter demographic where NAME is 'Thomas Nazario'. Then join with procedures on HADM_ID to get the procedures for that admission. Wait, but a patient can have multiple admissions. For example, if Thomas had two admissions, each with different HADM_IDs, then joining on HADM_ID would get procedures for all his admissions. But the question is asking for procedures of the patient, regardless of which admission. So perhaps we need to join on SUBJECT_ID instead. Because SUBJECT_ID is the patient's unique identifier. So if we join demographic and procedures on SUBJECT_ID, that would get all procedures for that patient across all admissions. But the question is about the procedure of the patient, not limited to a specific admission. So maybe the correct approach is to join on SUBJECT_ID. Wait, but in the data preview, the demographic table has SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Each row is a unique admission (HADM_ID) for a patient (SUBJECT_ID). So a patient can have multiple HADM_IDs. The procedures table also has SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. So each procedure is linked to a specific admission (HADM_ID) and patient (SUBJECT_ID). So if we want all procedures for Thomas Nazario, regardless of admission, we need to join on SUBJECT_ID. But how do we get the SUBJECT_ID for Thomas? Because the name is in demographic, so we can get his SUBJECT_ID(s) from there. Then, for each SUBJECT_ID, get all procedures from the procedures table where SUBJECT_ID matches. Wait, but the demographic table has one row per admission. So if Thomas has multiple admissions, he would have multiple rows in demographic with the same SUBJECT_ID but different HADM_IDs. So to get all his procedures, we need to find all procedures where SUBJECT_ID matches his SUBJECT_ID(s). But how to get his SUBJECT_ID? By filtering demographic where NAME is 'Thomas Nazario'. But since a patient can have multiple admissions, there could be multiple rows in demographic for the same SUBJECT_ID. So we need to select the SUBJECT_ID from demographic where NAME is 'Thomas Nazario', then join with procedures on SUBJECT_ID. But wait, the NAME field might not be unique. There could be multiple patients with the same name. But the question is about "patient Thomas Nazario", implying a single patient. So assuming that the name is unique, or that the user wants all procedures for any patient with that name. But in a real database, names aren't unique, but perhaps in this context, it's assumed that the name refers to a single patient. So the steps are: 1. Find the SUBJECT_ID(s) from demographic where NAME is 'Thomas Nazario'. 2. Join with procedures on SUBJECT_ID to get all procedures for those SUBJECT_IDs. 3. Select the SHORT_TITLE and ICD9_CODE from procedures. But in SQL, we can do this with an INNER JOIN between demographic and procedures on SUBJECT_ID, where demographic.NAME = 'Thomas Nazario', then select the required columns from procedures. Wait, but the procedures table has both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. So joining on SUBJECT_ID would get all procedures for that patient across all admissions. That's probably what the user wants. So the SQL would be: SELECT procedures."SHORT_TITLE", procedures."ICD9_CODE" FROM demographic INNER JOIN procedures ON demographic."SUBJECT_ID" = procedures."SUBJECT_ID" WHERE demographic."NAME" = 'Thomas Nazario'; But wait, in the data preview, the NAME in demographic is like "Michele Schmitt", "Jennifer Bellamy", etc. So the name is stored as a full name. So the user's input is "Thomas Nazario", which would match exactly the NAME field. So the WHERE clause should be WHERE demographic."NAME" = 'Thomas Nazario'. But the user might have a typo or case sensitivity. However, the schema doesn't mention case sensitivity, but the example uses "9951" in quotes, which is a string. So perhaps the NAME is stored as case-sensitive. But the user wrote "thomas nazario" in lowercase, but the actual data is in proper case. So to handle case insensitivity, maybe use LOWER(demographic."NAME") = 'thomas nazario'. But the example given in the job description uses LOWER() when matching strings. The instruction says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()". Looking back at the job description example: User: Find all patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951 Output SQL uses WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" Wait, but in the example, the ICD9_CODE is a string, and the value is "9951" in quotes. But the instruction says to use LOWER() when matching strings. Wait, the example doesn't use LOWER(), but maybe because the ICD9_CODE is a number stored as text, and the user input is a number. But in the case of names, which are text, the instruction says to use LOWER(). Wait, the job description says: * When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example] So for string comparisons, use LOWER() on both sides. For example, if the user asks for a name, convert the name to lowercase and compare with LOWER(column). In the example given, the user asked for ICD9 code 9951, which is a string, but the SQL uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" without LOWER, perhaps because the ICD9_CODE is stored as a string without case issues (all numbers). But for text fields like NAME, we should use LOWER. So in this case, the correct approach is to use LOWER(demographic."NAME") = LOWER('Thomas Nazario'). But in SQLite, the LOWER function is available. So the WHERE clause should be: WHERE LOWER(demographic."NAME") = 'thomas nazario' But the user wrote the name as "thomas nazario" in lowercase. Wait, the user's question is: "let me know both the short title and icd9 code of procedure of patient thomas nazario." So the name in the query is 'thomas nazario', but in the database, it's stored as 'Thomas Nazario' (proper case). So to make the comparison case-insensitive, we should use LOWER on both sides. So the WHERE clause becomes: WHERE LOWER(demographic."NAME") = LOWER('thomas nazario') But in SQLite, string comparisons are case-insensitive by default for ASCII characters? Or is it case-sensitive? Wait, SQLite's default is case-sensitive for LIKE, but for =, it depends on the collation. The default is binary, which is case-sensitive. So to ensure case-insensitive comparison, we need to use LOWER. So the correct condition is LOWER(demographic."NAME") = LOWER('thomas nazario'). But the user input in the question is

QUESTION: Out of total number of patients admitted before 2157, how many of them had long-term use of steroids?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."ADMITYEAR" < "2175" AND DIAGNOSES."SHORT_TITLE" = "Long-term use steroids"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants to know, out of all patients admitted before 2157, how many had long-term use of steroids. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The main tables here are demographic for patient admissions and prescriptions for medications. The demographic table has ADMITYEAR to check admission before 2157. The prescriptions table has DRUG which might include steroids. The user mentions "long-term use of steroids". In medical coding, long-term use might be indicated by specific ICD9 codes. Looking at the diagnoses table, the SHORT_TITLE could have terms like "Long-term use of steroids". So I should check the diagnoses table for that exact term. Wait, the data preview shows that diagnoses have SHORT_TITLE like "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". So if the user refers to "long-term use of steroids", the SHORT_TITLE in diagnoses might have that exact phrase. So the ICD9 code for that would be in diagnoses.ICD9_CODE. But the question is about patients who had long-term use of steroids. So I need to join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID or SUBJECT_ID. Since each patient can have multiple admissions (HADM_ID), but the question is about patients admitted before 2157, so we need to count distinct SUBJECT_ID from demographic where ADMITYEAR < 2157, and who have a diagnosis of long-term steroids. Wait, but the diagnoses are linked to HADM_ID. So a patient could have multiple admissions. But the question is about patients admitted before 2157, so their admission year is before 2157, and among those, how many had the diagnosis of long-term steroid use in any of their admissions? Alternatively, maybe the diagnosis is tied to a specific admission. But the user is asking for patients who had the diagnosis at any point, as long as they were admitted before 2157. So the approach would be: 1. Find all patients (distinct SUBJECT_ID) from demographic where ADMITYEAR < 2157. 2. Among those, find those who have a diagnosis with SHORT_TITLE = 'Long-term use of steroids'. So the query would involve joining demographic and diagnoses on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID? Or just SUBJECT_ID? Wait, the demographic table has HADM_ID as well, but each row is per admission. So each SUBJECT_ID can have multiple HADM_IDs. But the question is about patients (SUBJECT_ID) who were admitted before 2157 (any of their admissions?), and have a diagnosis of long-term steroids in any of their admissions. Wait, the user says "out of total number of patients admitted before 2157". So the total is the count of distinct SUBJECT_ID in demographic where ADMITYEAR < 2157. Then, the numerator is the count of distinct SUBJECT_ID in demographic where ADMITYEAR < 2157 and have a diagnosis of long-term steroids. So the query should select COUNT(DISTINCT demographic.SUBJECT_ID) from demographic INNER JOIN diagnoses ON demographic.SUBJECT_ID = diagnoses.SUBJECT_ID WHERE demographic.ADMITYEAR < 2157 AND diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE = 'Long-term use of steroids'. Wait, but the JOIN could be on HADM_ID as well, since each admission (HADM_ID) in demographic corresponds to an admission in diagnoses. But if a patient was admitted multiple times before 2157, and in one of those admissions had the diagnosis, they should be counted. So joining on HADM_ID would link the specific admission where the diagnosis was made. But the ADMITYEAR is per admission. So the demographic table's ADMITYEAR is for that specific admission. So if a patient had an admission in 2156 (ADMITYEAR < 2157) and another in 2158, but the diagnosis was in the 2156 admission, then they should be counted. But if the diagnosis was in the 2158 admission (which is after 2157), but the patient had an admission before 2157, should that count? The question is about patients admitted before 2157, regardless of when the diagnosis was made. Wait, the question is "how many of them had long-term use of steroids". So the steroids could be diagnosed in any admission, as long as the patient was admitted at least once before 2157. Or is it that the diagnosis was during an admission before 2157? The question is a bit ambiguous, but the user's phrasing is "admitted before 2157" and "had long-term use of steroids". It's possible that the diagnosis could be in any admission, but the patient must have been admitted at least once before 2157. Alternatively, the diagnosis must be in an admission before 2157. The question is not entirely clear, but likely, the intended approach is to find patients who were admitted before 2157 and have a diagnosis (in any of their admissions) of long-term steroids. But to be precise, perhaps the diagnosis should be in the same admission that was before 2157. Because the demographic table's ADMITYEAR is per admission. So each row in demographic is a specific admission. So if we join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID, then we can ensure that the diagnosis was made during an admission that was before 2157. So the correct approach would be: Select count(distinct demographic.SUBJECT_ID) from demographic inner join diagnoses on demographic.HADM_ID = diagnoses.HADM_ID where demographic.ADMITYEAR < 2157 and diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE = 'Long-term use of steroids' This way, we're counting patients who had at least one admission before 2157 where they were diagnosed with long-term steroid use. But wait, the user's question is "out of total number of patients admitted before 2157, how many had long-term use of steroids". The total is patients admitted before 2157 (count distinct SUBJECT_ID where ADMITYEAR < 2157). The numerator is patients who have at least one admission before 2157 and have the diagnosis in any of their admissions (or in the same admission?). But the way the question is phrased, it's possible that the diagnosis could be in any admission, not necessarily the same one that was before 2157. However, that's less likely. Typically, such questions imply that the diagnosis is during the admission period in question. But the user's exact wording is "had long-term use of steroids", which is a condition the patient has, not necessarily tied to a specific admission. However, in the database, diagnoses are tied to admissions via HADM_ID. This is a bit tricky. Let's look at the data preview. In the DIAGNOSES table, each row is linked to a HADM_ID. So each diagnosis is associated with a specific hospital admission. Therefore, to find patients who had a diagnosis of long-term steroids in any of their admissions (regardless of when that admission was), but the patient must have been admitted at least once before 2157. But that would require two steps: first, find all patients with any admission before 2157 (regardless of diagnosis), then among those, find those who have any diagnosis (in any admission) of long-term steroids. Alternatively, if the diagnosis must be in an admission before 2157, then the join should be on HADM_ID and the ADMITYEAR < 2157. The question is ambiguous, but given the context, the likely correct interpretation is that the diagnosis is in the same admission that was before 2157. Because otherwise, the patient could have been admitted in 2156 (before 2157) and then diagnosed with steroids in 2158, which is after, but the user's question is about patients admitted before 2157 and had the condition. But without more context, it's safer to assume that the diagnosis is during an admission before 2157. Therefore, the correct SQL would join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID, filter where ADMITYEAR < 2157 and SHORT_TITLE is 'Long-term use of steroids', then count distinct SUBJECT_ID. But wait, the user's question is "Out of total number of patients admitted before 2157, how many of them had long-term use of steroids?" So the total is the count of distinct SUBJECT_ID in demographic where ADMITYEAR < 2157. The numerator is the count of distinct SUBJECT_ID in demographic where ADMITYEAR < 2157 and they have at least one diagnosis of long-term steroids in any of their admissions (including those before 2157). Wait, but if the diagnosis is in an admission after 2157, but the patient had an admission before 2157, should that count? The question is about patients admitted before 2157 (regardless of when the diagnosis was made). So the answer would include those patients who were admitted before 2157 and at any point (even after) had the diagnosis. But in the database, diagnoses are tied to admissions. So if a patient was admitted in 2156 and again in 2158, and had the diagnosis in 2158, then they would have a demographic entry for 2158, but the ADMITYEAR for that admission is 2158, which is not <2157. So to have a diagnosis in 2158, the HADM_ID would be linked to a demographic row with ADMITYEAR 2158. Therefore, if we join on HADM_ID, the diagnosis in 2158 would not be included because the ADMITYEAR is >=2157. Therefore, to capture patients who were

QUESTION: let me know the number of government health insurance patients who have ntprobnp lab test.

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN LAB on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = LAB.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."INSURANCE" = "Government" AND LAB."LABEL" = "NTproBNP"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the number of government health insurance patients who had an NT-proBNP lab test. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The demographic table has insurance information, and the lab table has lab tests. The insurance field in demographic indicates if it's government (like Medicare/Medicaid). The lab tests are in the lab table, where the LABEL column should have 'NT-proBNP'. I need to join these tables on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID to ensure the lab tests correspond to the right patients. But wait, in the demographic table, both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID are present. However, each HADM_ID is unique to a patient's admission. Since a patient can have multiple admissions, but the insurance is per admission? Or is it per patient? The schema says when counting patients, use demographic.subject_id. So maybe insurance is per admission, but the user wants unique patients. So I should count distinct subject_id from demographic. Wait, the insurance is in demographic, which is per admission. But a patient might have different insurance across admissions. However, the question is about patients with government insurance, but it's unclear if it's any admission or all. The user probably wants any patient who had at least one admission with government insurance and had the lab test. So join on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID between demographic and lab. So the steps are: 1. Select from demographic where insurance is government (like 'Medicare' or 'Medicaid'). But the exact value in the insurance column might be 'Government' or specific names. Looking at the data preview, in demographic, the insurance has values like 'Medicare' and 'Private'. So the user says "government health insurance", which likely includes Medicare and Medicaid. But how is that represented in the data? The example shows "Medicare" as a value. So perhaps the insurance column has 'Medicare' for government. The user might mean patients where INSURANCE is in a government category. But without knowing all possible values, perhaps the question refers to INSURANCE = 'Medicare' or 'Medicaid'? Or maybe the data uses 'Government' as a value. But in the data preview, one row has 'Medicare' and another 'Private'. So maybe the user considers 'Medicare' as government. Alternatively, maybe the insurance field has a value like 'Government' but the example shows 'Medicare'. Hmm. The user's question says "government health insurance patients". In the US, government insurance includes Medicare and Medicaid. So perhaps the INSURANCE column has values like 'Medicare' or 'Medicaid'. So the condition would be WHERE demographic.INSURANCE IN ('Medicare', 'Medicaid'). But looking at the data preview, the example rows have 'Medicare' and 'Private' and 'Medicaid' might be another value. However, in the provided data preview for demographic, the insurance is 'Medicare' and 'Private'. So perhaps the correct filter is WHERE demographic.INSURANCE IN ('Medicare', 'Medicaid') but if Medicaid isn't present, maybe it's just 'Medicare'. Alternatively, maybe the insurance field has a value 'Government'—but the example shows 'Medicare' as a specific type. The user might not know the exact values, so perhaps the question assumes that 'government' is represented as 'Medicare' or another specific value. Alternatively, maybe the insurance column has a category 'Government' but in the data preview, it's 'Medicare'. This is a bit ambiguous. But given the example data, perhaps the correct approach is to filter where INSURANCE is 'Medicare' or 'Medicaid'. However, in the data preview, one row has 'Medicare' and another 'Private'. So perhaps the user's intent is to include any patient with insurance categorized as government, which in the data is 'Medicare'. Alternatively, maybe the insurance field has a value 'Government'—but the example shows 'Medicare'. This is a problem. Since the data preview shows 'Medicare' as a government insurance, perhaps the correct filter is WHERE demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicare' OR demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicaid' (if Medicaid exists). But without knowing all possible values, perhaps the user just wants 'Medicare' as the government insurance. Alternatively, maybe the question considers 'Medicare' as the only government insurance here. Alternatively, maybe the insurance field has a value 'Government' which is not present in the sample data. This is a bit tricky. But given the example data, perhaps the correct approach is to use WHERE demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicare' as the government insurance. Alternatively, the user might have a broader definition. But since the data preview shows 'Medicare' as a government insurance, perhaps that's the value to use. Next, the lab test is 'NT-proBNP'. Looking at the lab table's LABEL column, in the data preview, there's 'Lactate', 'Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)', 'Albumin'. So the LABEL must exactly match 'NT-proBNP'. So the condition would be lab.LABEL = 'NT-proBNP'. But the user wrote "ntprobnp lab test", which is lowercase. However, in the data, the labels are in title case. So perhaps the LABEL is stored as 'NT-proBNP' or similar. To be safe, maybe use LOWER(lab.LABEL) = 'nt-probnp' or 'ntprobnp'? The user wrote "ntprobnp", which could be a typo. The actual label might be 'NT-proBNP' or 'BNP' or similar. But according to the problem statement, when matching strings, use LOWER(). So the correct condition would be LOWER(lab.LABEL) = 'ntprobnp'. But the user's input is "ntprobnp", so the code should match that exactly in lowercase. So the WHERE clause would have LOWER(lab.LABEL) = 'ntprobnp'. So putting it all together: Join demographic and lab on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. Wait, the demographic table has HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. Each HADM_ID is a unique admission, and SUBJECT_ID is the patient. So to link a lab test to a patient's admission, we join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Because a patient can have multiple admissions, and each lab test is associated with a specific admission (HADM_ID). So the correct join is ON demographic.SUBJECT_ID = lab.SUBJECT_ID AND demographic.HADM_ID = lab.HADM_ID. Then, filter where demographic.INSURANCE is in the government category (assuming 'Medicare' and/or 'Medicaid'), and lab.LABEL (lowercase) is 'ntprobnp'. Finally, count the distinct SUBJECT_ID from demographic to get the number of unique patients. So the SQL would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT demographic."SUBJECT_ID") FROM demographic INNER JOIN lab ON demographic."SUBJECT_ID" = lab."SUBJECT_ID" AND demographic."HADM_ID" = lab."HADM_ID" WHERE (demographic."INSURANCE" = 'Medicare' OR demographic."INSURANCE" = 'Medicaid') AND LOWER(lab."LABEL") = 'ntprobnp'; Wait, but in the data preview, the insurance has 'Medicare' and 'Private'. So if the user's government insurance includes 'Medicare' and 'Medicaid', but in the data, perhaps only 'Medicare' is present. But the user's question is about government insurance, which may include both. However, without knowing all possible values, perhaps the correct approach is to check for 'Medicare' or 'Medicaid'. But in the data preview, there's a patient with 'Medicare' and another with 'Private'. So the insurance field can have 'Medicare' as a government type. If the user's question includes both, but the data may not have 'Medicaid', the query would still work, returning patients with Medicare who had the test. Alternatively, maybe the insurance field has a value 'Government' which encompasses all government insurance. But in the data preview, it's 'Medicare', so perhaps the correct value is 'Medicare'. Alternatively, maybe the user intended 'Government' as a category, but the data uses specific names. This is a possible ambiguity. However, given the example data, the insurance 'Medicare' is considered government. So the WHERE clause should check for demographic.INSURANCE in ('Medicare', 'Medicaid') if both are government, but if the data only has 'Medicare', then just 'Medicare'. But the user's question is about "government health insurance", which is a category that includes Medicare and Medicaid. So the correct approach is to filter where INSURANCE is in those. However, without knowing the exact values in the insurance field, this is a guess. But according to the data preview, 'Medicare' is a value. So perhaps the correct condition is demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicare' OR demographic.INSURANCE = 'Medicaid'. But if the data uses different terms, this might not capture all. However, given the information, this is the best approach. Alternatively, maybe the insurance field has a value 'Government', but that's not seen in the preview. Since the user can't specify, perhaps the answer should use 'Medicare' as the government insurance, as per the data preview example. Wait, the user's instruction says: When asked use SHORT_TITLE

QUESTION: among the total number of urgent admissions, how many of them were male patients?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."GENDER" = "M" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."ADMISSION_TYPE" = "URGENT"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants to know, among all urgent admissions, how many were male patients. First, I need to identify which table has the admission type. The demographic table has "ADMISSION_TYPE" which likely includes 'URGENT'. Also, gender is in the demographic table as "GENDER". The question is about counting urgent admissions that are male. Since each admission is tied to a HADM_ID, but the user might want the count of distinct patients (SUBJECT_ID) to avoid counting the same patient multiple times if they had multiple urgent admissions. Wait, the user says "total number of urgent admissions", so maybe count the HADM_IDs. But the second part is "how many of them were male patients". So perhaps each admission is counted, and for each urgent admission, check if the patient is male. But in the demographic table, each HADM_ID is associated with a SUBJECT_ID and their gender. So for each urgent admission (ADMISSION_TYPE = 'URGENT'), we need to count how many have GENDER = 'M'. So the steps are: 1. Select all records from demographic where ADMISSION_TYPE is 'URGENT'. 2. From those, count how many have GENDER = 'M'. But wait, the COUNT would be the number of rows where both conditions are met. Alternatively, use a SUM with a CASE statement, but maybe simpler to use a WHERE clause to filter first. Wait, the user wants the total number of urgent admissions, and out of those, how many were male. So the total urgent admissions is the count of HADM_ID where ADMISSION_TYPE is 'URGENT', and then among those, count where GENDER is 'M'. But since each HADM_ID is unique per admission, perhaps COUNT(DISTINCT HADM_ID) is not needed if each row in demographic is per admission. Looking at the schema, demographic has HADM_ID, which is unique per admission. So each row in demographic represents one admission. So ADMISSION_TYPE is per admission. So the query would be: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM demographic WHERE ADMISSION_TYPE = 'URGENT' AND GENDER = 'M'; But wait, the user says "among the total number of urgent admissions, how many were male". So the total urgent admissions is the count of all admissions where ADMISSION_TYPE is 'URGENT', and the count of males in that group is the subset where GENDER is 'M'. So the answer is the count of rows where both conditions are met. Alternatively, if the user wants the count of male patients (distinct SUBJECT_ID) among urgent admissions, but the question says "how many of them were male patients", where "them" refers to the urgent admissions. So each admission is an event, and each can be male or female. So count the number of urgent admissions where the patient was male. Therefore, the correct approach is to count the number of rows in demographic where ADMISSION_TYPE is 'URGENT' and GENDER is 'M'. So the SQL would be: SELECT COUNT("HADM_ID") FROM demographic WHERE "ADMISSION_TYPE" = 'URGENT' AND "GENDER" = 'M'; But since HADM_ID is unique, COUNT(*) would also work. However, using COUNT("HADM_ID") is explicit. Also, the table name is "demographic", and the columns are in quotes as per the schema. Wait, in the example given, they used COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ), but here, since each HADM_ID is unique per admission, perhaps we don't need DISTINCT. Because each HADM_ID is one admission. So if a patient has multiple urgent admissions, each would be a separate HADM_ID. So counting HADM_IDs gives the number of admissions, not patients. But the question is about admissions, not patients. The user asked "among the total number of urgent admissions, how many of them were male patients". So each admission is tied to a patient's gender. So the count is the number of urgent admissions where the patient was male. Therefore, the correct SQL is to count HADM_ID where ADMISSION_TYPE is 'URGENT' and GENDER is 'M'. So the final query would be: SELECT COUNT("HADM_ID") FROM demographic WHERE "ADMISSION_TYPE" = 'URGENT' AND "GENDER" = 'M'; Alternatively, COUNT(*) would also work, but using the specific column might be better. However, in SQLite, COUNT(*) is efficient and counts all rows that meet the conditions. Since each row is a unique admission, either approach is correct. But to be precise, using "HADM_ID" is safe. Also, the user's example uses quotes around the table and column names, so following that, the columns should be in quotes and the table name in lowercase as per the schema (the CREATE TABLE statements use lowercase for the table names, but in the data preview, it's uppercase. Wait, the schema shows CREATE TABLE "demographic" which is lowercase, but in the data preview, it's written as TABLE DEMOGRAPHIC. But in SQL, the table names are case-insensitive in SQLite, but when using quotes, they become case-sensitive. So the correct table name is "demographic" as per the schema. Wait, the schema shows: CREATE TABLE "demographic" (...); So the actual table name is "demographic" (with quotes), but in SQLite, if created with quotes, the name is stored as is. However, in the example, the user wrote: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN... But the table name in the schema is "demographic" (lowercase), but in the example, it's written as DEMOGRAPHIC (uppercase). But SQLite is case-insensitive for table names, so it's okay. However, to be precise, the correct table name is "demographic" as per the schema. But the example uses DEMOGRAPHIC, so perhaps the user expects the table name in uppercase. But the actual table name is "demographic" as per the CREATE TABLE statement. Wait, no: the CREATE TABLE statement is CREATE TABLE "demographic" (...), which means the table name is stored as "demographic" (with quotes), but in SQLite, if you create a table with quotes, the name is stored as the exact string inside the quotes. So the table name is demographic, without quotes, but the quotes in the CREATE TABLE are for escaping. Wait, no: in SQLite, when you write CREATE TABLE "demographic" (...), the table name is demographic, and the quotes are used to enclose the identifier. So the actual table name is demographic, and you can refer to it as DEMOGRAPHIC, Demographic, etc., because SQLite is case-insensitive. However, in the example, the user wrote FROM DEMOGRAPHIC, which is uppercase, but the schema has it in lowercase. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the table name as it is in the schema, which is "demographic", but in the example, they used DEMOGRAPHIC. So maybe the table is actually named DEMOGRAPHIC, but the schema shows "demographic" because of the quotes. This is a bit confusing. But given that the example uses DEMOGRAPHIC, perhaps the correct table name in the query is DEMOGRAPHIC. However, in SQLite, the case doesn't matter. So perhaps it's safer to use the exact name as in the schema, which is "demographic", but the example uses DEMOGRAPHIC. Maybe the user intended the table names to be uppercase. Let me check the data preview. In the data preview, it's written as TABLE DEMOGRAPHIC:, so perhaps the actual table name is DEMOGRAPHIC. But the schema says CREATE TABLE "demographic" (...). This is conflicting. Wait, perhaps the schema is written with quotes, but the actual table name is demographic. But in SQLite, the table names are case-insensitive. So regardless of how it's written in the CREATE TABLE, you can refer to it in any case. So in the query, using demographic or DEMOGRAPHIC is the same. But the example uses DEMOGRAPHIC, so perhaps the user expects that. So in the query, I'll use DEMOGRAPHIC as the table name. So putting it all together: SELECT COUNT("HADM_ID") FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE "ADMISSION_TYPE" = 'URGENT' AND "GENDER" = 'M'; But wait, the user's example uses COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ), but in this case, since each HADM_ID is unique per admission, we don't need DISTINCT. Because each row in demographic is a unique admission (HADM_ID is unique per row). So COUNT("HADM_ID") would count each admission once. Alternatively, COUNT(*) would also work. But to be explicit, using HADM_ID is better. Another point: the user's example uses quotes around the column names, like DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID". So in this case, the columns should be in quotes and prefixed with the table name. However, in the WHERE clause, when referring to columns, do we need to prefix them with the table name? In this case, since all columns are from the same table (DEMOGRAPHIC), it's not necessary, but the example does it. Wait, in the example, they have DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID"

QUESTION: How many female patients use a drug named theophylline sr?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PRESCRIPTIONS on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PRESCRIPTIONS.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."GENDER" = "F" AND PRESCRIPTIONS."DRUG" = "Theophylline SR"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants to know how many female patients are using a drug named theophylline sr. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The demographic table has patient information, including gender. The prescriptions table has drug information. Since we're counting patients, we'll need to join these tables. The demographic table's SUBJECT_ID is unique per patient, so we should count distinct SUBJECT_ID from there. But wait, prescriptions also have SUBJECT_ID. However, joining on HADM_ID might be necessary because each admission (HADM_ID) is linked to a patient's SUBJECT_ID. But the question is about patients, not admissions. So maybe joining on SUBJECT_ID directly is sufficient. Wait, but a patient can have multiple admissions. However, if we count distinct SUBJECT_ID from demographic, that should give the correct count of unique patients, regardless of how many admissions they had. So the join between demographic and prescriptions should be on SUBJECT_ID. Wait, but looking at the schema, both tables have SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. So perhaps the correct way is to join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID to ensure that the prescription is linked to the correct admission for the patient. But the question is about any use of the drug, regardless of admission. However, prescriptions are tied to a specific HADM_ID. So a patient might have the drug in multiple admissions, but we just need to count them once. So joining on SUBJECT_ID would be enough, but maybe HADM_ID is not necessary. Wait, but the prescriptions table has both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. So to accurately link the prescription to the patient's demographic data, we should join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. But since the demographic table has one row per HADM_ID (since each HADM_ID is a unique admission for a patient), joining on both would ensure that we're linking the prescription to the correct admission. However, if a patient has multiple admissions where they were prescribed the drug, we still want to count them once. So even if they have multiple HADM_IDs with the drug, we need to count the SUBJECT_ID only once. Therefore, the join should be on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID to correctly associate the prescription with the admission, but when counting, we use DISTINCT demographic.SUBJECT_ID to avoid duplicates from multiple admissions. Next, the WHERE clause needs to filter for female patients and the drug name. The gender in demographic is stored in the GENDER column, so we check WHERE demographic.GENDER = 'F'. For the drug, the prescriptions table has a DRUG column. The user specified "theophylline sr", so we need to match that exactly. However, in the data preview, the DRUG entries are like "Pneumococcal Vac Polyvalent", "Bisacodyl", etc. The exact case might vary, but the user's instruction says to use exact terms. But the example given in the job description uses LOWER() for matching. Wait, the job description says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()". Wait, in the example, the user asked for ICD9 9951, and the SQL uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". But in the data_preview for diagnoses, the ICD9_CODE is in quotes like "2761", "4280". So maybe the ICD9_CODE is stored as text. But the example didn't use LOWER(), but the job description says to use LOWER() when matching strings. Wait, the job description's example didn't use LOWER(), but the instruction says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". Hmm, the example given in the job description has DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", which is a numeric code, so maybe that's why. But for text fields like SHORT_TITLE, the instruction says to use exact terms as asked. Wait, the user instruction says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So for diagnoses' SHORT_TITLE, exact match. But for the prescriptions' DRUG, the user says "theophylline sr". So we need to match the DRUG column exactly to 'theophylline sr', but perhaps case-insensitive. However, the job description's example for diagnoses uses exact code, but for text fields, maybe we should use LOWER. Wait, the job description says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()". So perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER(prescriptions.DRUG) = 'theophylline sr' in lowercase. But the user's question says "drug named theophylline sr", which is case-insensitive. So to ensure case-insensitive match, we should use LOWER on both sides. So the condition would be LOWER(prescriptions.DRUG) = LOWER('theophylline sr'). But in SQLite, string comparisons are case-insensitive by default when using =, but it's better to be explicit. Wait, SQLite's default is case-sensitive for =, unless the column has a collation defined. Since we don't know the collation, safer to use LOWER. So the WHERE clause would be: WHERE demographic.GENDER = 'F' AND LOWER(prescriptions.DRUG) = 'theophylline sr' But wait, the user wrote "theophylline sr" with a space and lowercase. So the exact string in the database might be in a different case, like 'Theophylline SR'. So using LOWER on prescriptions.DRUG would convert it to lowercase, and we compare to 'theophylline sr'. So the condition would be correct. Putting it all together: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT demographic."SUBJECT_ID") FROM demographic INNER JOIN prescriptions ON demographic."SUBJECT_ID" = prescriptions."SUBJECT_ID" WHERE demographic."GENDER" = 'F' AND LOWER(prescriptions."DRUG") = 'theophylline sr' Wait, but in the example provided in the job description, they joined on HADM_ID between demographic and diagnoses. Looking at the schema, demographic has HADM_ID, and diagnoses also has HADM_ID. So perhaps the correct join is on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. Wait, the demographic table's primary key is probably SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID, as each HADM_ID is a unique admission for a patient. So prescriptions are per HADM_ID as well. So to correctly link the prescription to the demographic data (which is per admission), we should join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Because a patient can have multiple admissions, and each prescription is tied to a specific admission (HADM_ID). So the correct join would be ON demographic.SUBJECT_ID = prescriptions.SUBJECT_ID AND demographic.HADM_ID = prescriptions.HADM_ID. Otherwise, if a patient has multiple admissions, and in one of them they were prescribed the drug, but in another they weren't, joining only on SUBJECT_ID would include all their admissions, which might not have the drug. Wait, but the prescriptions table has both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. So each prescription is linked to a specific admission. Therefore, to ensure that the prescription is from the same admission as the demographic data (which includes gender), we need to join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Because the demographic data is per admission (each row is a unique HADM_ID). So the correct join is on both columns. So the corrected SQL would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT demographic."SUBJECT_ID") FROM demographic INNER JOIN prescriptions ON demographic."SUBJECT_ID" = prescriptions."SUBJECT_ID" AND demographic."HADM_ID" = prescriptions."HADM_ID" WHERE demographic."GENDER" = 'F' AND LOWER(prescriptions."DRUG") = 'theophylline sr' This ensures that we're linking the prescription to the correct admission for the patient, and then counting distinct patients (SUBJECT_ID) who are female and have a prescription for the drug in any of their admissions. But wait, the user's question is about patients who use the drug, regardless of which admission. So if a patient was prescribed the drug in any admission, they should be counted. However, the demographic table has one row per admission. So if a patient has multiple admissions, each with their own demographic data (but same SUBJECT_ID), joining on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID would only count the admissions where the drug was prescribed. But since we're counting distinct SUBJECT_IDs, even if they have multiple admissions with the drug, they would be counted once. So the join on both keys is correct because it ensures that the prescription is from the same admission as the demographic data (which includes the gender). Otherwise, if we joined only on SUBJECT_ID, we might link to a prescription from a different admission where the gender might be different (though gender is unlikely to change, but other attributes might). But in this case, gender is a patient attribute, not admission-specific. Wait, looking at the demographic table's schema, it includes GENDER, which is a patient attribute. However, in the data preview, for example, SUBJECT_ID 10006 has HADM_ID 142345, and GENDER is 'F'. So if a patient has multiple admissions, their GENDER should be the same across all their demographic entries. Therefore, joining on SUBJECT_ID alone would be sufficient for GENDER, but prescriptions are per HADM_ID. So if we join only on SUBJECT_ID, we might

QUESTION: what is the average age of male patients with a private insurance policy?

TRUE: SELECT AVG ( DEMOGRAPHIC."AGE" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."GENDER" = "M" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."INSURANCE" = "Private"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the average age of male patients with private insurance. First, I need to identify the relevant table. The question mentions demographic information like age, gender, and insurance, so the 'demographic' table is the right place. The columns needed are AGE, GENDER, and INSURANCE. The average age is calculated using AVG(AGE). But wait, should I use DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID to avoid counting the same patient multiple times? The user says "patients," so each patient should be counted once. However, since each HADM_ID is a hospital admission, a patient might have multiple entries. But the question is about patients, not admissions. So I should group by SUBJECT_ID to get each patient once. But the AGE might be the same across admissions. Hmm, but in the data preview, each SUBJECT_ID has a specific AGE. For example, SUBJECT_ID 10006 has AGE 70. So maybe AGE is per admission? Wait, no, age is likely based on DOB, so it's calculated per admission. But the problem is, if a patient is admitted multiple times, their age would change. However, the question is about the average age of male patients with private insurance. So if a patient has multiple admissions with private insurance, their age might vary. But the user probably wants the average age at the time of admission for all such patients. Or maybe each patient is counted once, using their latest age? This is a bit ambiguous. But looking at the job description, when counting patients, we should count by demographic.subject_id. So perhaps for each patient (subject_id), we take their age from their latest admission or any admission? But the data might have the same age across admissions. For example, if a patient is admitted multiple times in the same year, their age might be the same. But to avoid counting the same patient multiple times, we need to select each subject_id once. So maybe we should get the DISTINCT subject_id and their age, then average that. But how to handle cases where the same subject_id has different ages in different admissions? For example, if a patient is admitted at age 30 and again at 31, which age do we take? The problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps the user wants the average age across all admissions that meet the criteria. But the question is about "patients," which implies each patient once. So maybe we need to get the age of each patient (each subject_id) once, perhaps their latest age. But that complicates the query. However, given the data schema, the AGE column is in the demographic table, which is per admission. So each row in demographic represents an admission (HADM_ID). Therefore, a patient can have multiple rows in demographic. The user's question is about the average age of male patients with private insurance. So if a patient has multiple admissions with private insurance, each admission's age would be counted. But that might not be correct. For example, a patient admitted at 30 and 31 would contribute 30 and 31 to the average, but the user might want each patient counted once, using their age at first admission or latest. But the question isn't clear. However, the job description says when counting patients, count by demographic.subject_id. So perhaps for this average, we should take each patient once, using their age from a single admission. But how to choose which admission? Maybe the first one, or any. But the data might have the same age across all admissions for a patient. Alternatively, perhaps the AGE is the patient's age at the time of admission, and if they have multiple admissions, their age varies. But the user might want the average age of all admissions where the patient is male and has private insurance. Or the average age of male patients (each counted once) who have at least one private insurance admission. This is ambiguous. The job description example for counting patients uses COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID"). So for average age, perhaps we should take the average of the ages of each distinct subject_id that meets the criteria. But how to ensure each subject_id is counted once, using their age from one admission. For example, if a patient has two admissions with private insurance at ages 30 and 31, which age do we use? The answer depends on the user's intent, which isn't clear. But given the example, when counting patients, they use DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID. So for average age, perhaps we should take the average of the ages of each distinct subject_id, but how to get one age per subject_id. One approach is to select the average age from the demographic table where gender is male and insurance is private, but group by subject_id and take the average of those. Wait, no. If we select distinct subject_id, we can get their age. But how to ensure we get one age per subject_id. Maybe the age is consistent across all their admissions. For example, in the data preview, SUBJECT_ID 10006 has AGE 70, and if they have another admission, maybe the age is 70 as well. But that's unlikely. So perhaps the age is calculated based on DOB and admission time. But the DOB is fixed, so age would be admission time minus DOB. Therefore, each admission's age is different. So a patient's age can vary across admissions. In that case, the user's question is ambiguous. But given the example in the job description, when asked for patients diagnosed with a certain code, they join on HADM_ID and count distinct subject_id. So perhaps for this question, the user wants the average age of all admissions where the patient is male and has private insurance. But that's not clear. Alternatively, they might want the average age of male patients (each patient once) who have at least one private insurance policy. In that case, we need to get each subject_id once, and their age at some point (maybe the first admission, or the latest). But without more information, perhaps the intended approach is to average the age from all admissions that meet the criteria (male, private insurance), which could include multiple entries per patient. However, the example in the job description uses COUNT(DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID), which suggests that when counting patients, they count each once. For average age, perhaps the same applies: take each patient once, and average their age. But how to get their age? Maybe take the age from their first admission, or any admission. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the average age across all admissions meeting the criteria, regardless of whether they are the same patient. But that would count a patient multiple times if they have multiple admissions. The question is: "average age of male patients with a private insurance policy". The term "patients" suggests each patient once. So we need to calculate the average age of each unique patient (subject_id) who is male and has private insurance, using their age from their admissions. But which admission? If a patient has multiple admissions with private insurance, which age to use? Maybe the latest one, but that requires finding the max ADMITTIME for each subject_id. That complicates the query. Alternatively, perhaps the age in the demographic table is the patient's age at the time of admission, and the insurance is per admission. So the user might want the average age across all admissions where the patient is male and has private insurance. But that would include multiple entries per patient. But the example in the job description counts distinct subject_id when asked about patients. So for this question, perhaps the correct approach is to select distinct subject_id, get their age (but which one?), and average those. However, if a patient has multiple admissions with private insurance, their age might differ each time. So which age to pick? Maybe the first one, or the latest. This is a problem. Without clarification, perhaps the intended answer is to average the age from all admissions where gender is male and insurance is private, without considering distinct patients. But that would be incorrect if the same patient is admitted multiple times. Alternatively, the correct approach is to first get distinct subject_ids with private insurance and male, then for each, get their age from their demographic entries, perhaps the average of their ages across those admissions. But that's more complex. But given the example in the job description, when the user asked for patients diagnosed with a certain code, the query counts distinct subject_id. So for this question, perhaps the average should be of the ages of distinct subject_ids who have at least one admission with private insurance and are male. But how to get their age? Because a subject_id can have multiple admissions with different ages. One approach is to select the average age from the demographic table where gender is male and insurance is private, but group by subject_id and take, say, the min(age) or max(age), then average those. But that requires a subquery. Alternatively, perhaps the data is structured such that each subject_id has a single demographic entry, but that's not the case. Looking at the data preview, SUBJECT_ID 10006 has HADM_ID 142345, and another SUBJECT_ID 10011 has HADM_ID 105331, etc. So each row is a unique HADM_ID, meaning a subject can have multiple rows. So, to get each patient once, we need to select distinct subject_id, and for each, get their age. But which age? Maybe the age from their first admission, or the latest. But without knowing, perhaps the user expects to average all ages from all admissions that meet the criteria (male and private insurance), even if that includes the same patient multiple times. But the example in the job description uses COUNT(DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID), which

QUESTION: what is the number of patients who had coronary arteriography using two catheters and were born before 2109?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PROCEDURES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PROCEDURES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."DOB_YEAR" < "2109" AND PROCEDURES."LONG_TITLE" = "Coronary arteriography using two catheters"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the number of patients who had coronary arteriography using two catheters and were born before 2109. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The procedures table likely contains information about medical procedures like arteriography. The demographic table has patient birth years. The question mentions "coronary arteriography using two catheters." Looking at the procedures table's SHORT_TITLE examples, maybe there's a specific ICD9_CODE or SHORT_TITLE that matches this procedure. The user said to use exact terms, so I should check if "coronary arteriography using two catheters" is a SHORT_TITLE in the procedures table. Assuming that's the case, I'll join the procedures and demographic tables on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. Wait, actually, both tables have SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. To get the correct patients, I should join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID to ensure the procedure is linked to the right admission. Then, filter the procedures where SHORT_TITLE is exactly 'coronary arteriography using two catheters'. Also, filter demographic where DOB_YEAR is less than 2109. Since we need the count of distinct patients, I'll use COUNT(DISTINCT demographic.SUBJECT_ID). Make sure to use quotes around table and column names as specified, and use SQLite syntax. Wait, the example shows using LOWER() for string matching, but the user said to use exact terms. So maybe the SHORT_TITLE is case-sensitive. But the example in the data_preview for diagnoses uses exact matches. The user instruction says when asked, use SHORT_TITLE to search and exact term. So no need for LOWER() here, just exact match. So the final query should select count distinct subject_id from demographic joined with procedures on both subject_id and hadm_id, where procedures.short_title is 'coronary arteriography using two catheters' and demographic.dob_year < 2109. Check if the join needs both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Yes, because a patient can have multiple admissions (HADM_ID), so joining on both ensures the procedure is from the same admission as the demographic data. So the SQL would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT demographic."SUBJECT_ID") FROM demographic INNER JOIN procedures ON demographic."SUBJECT_ID" = procedures."SUBJECT_ID" AND demographic."HADM_ID" = procedures."HADM_ID" WHERE procedures."SHORT_TITLE" = 'coronary arteriography using two catheters' AND demographic."DOB_YEAR" < 2109; I need to make sure the table names are quoted correctly and the string is in single quotes. Wait, in SQLite, string literals use single quotes. The example uses double quotes for the ICD9_CODE value, but maybe that's a mistake. Wait, looking at the example given: In the example, the user's output was WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". But in SQLite, string literals should be in single quotes. However, the example uses double quotes. But the user might have a specific setup. Wait, the job description says to assume SQLite and be careful with functions. But in SQLite, string literals are single-quoted. However, the example provided by the user uses double quotes for the value. Hmm, maybe the data has the ICD9_CODE stored as a string with quotes, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake in the example. But the user's example shows using double quotes for the value. To follow the example, perhaps we should use double quotes here. But according to standard SQL, it's single quotes. This is a bit confusing. Wait, looking at the data_preview for diagnoses, the ICD9_CODE is in double quotes, but that's just the CSV format. In the actual table, the ICD9_CODE is a TEXT field. So in the SQL query, the literal should be in single quotes. But the example provided by the user has WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", which uses double quotes for the value. That's incorrect in standard SQL. Maybe the user's system allows it, or it's a typo. But to be correct in SQLite, it should be '9951'. However, the user's example uses double quotes, so perhaps we should follow that to match their expected output. But the user's instruction says to assume SQLite. So the correct way is to use single quotes for string literals. However, the example provided by the user uses double quotes. This is conflicting. The user might have a mistake in their example. But since the user provided that example, perhaps we should replicate the style. Let me check the example again: In the example, the output is: WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" But in SQLite, "9951" would be treated as a string if the column is text, but using double quotes is for identifiers. Wait, no— in SQLite, double quotes are for identifiers, single quotes for strings. So the example is actually incorrect. But the user provided it, so maybe they expect us to use double quotes for string literals. But that's not correct. However, to adhere strictly to the user's example, perhaps we should use double quotes. Alternatively, maybe the ICD9_CODE is a numeric field, but in the schema, it's TEXT. Wait, in the schema, DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" is TEXT. So the value should be a string. Therefore, in the example, "9951" is incorrect; it should be '9951'. But the user's example uses double quotes. This is a problem. The user might have a mistake, but we need to follow their example. Alternatively, perhaps in their data, the ICD9_CODE is stored without quotes, but that's unlikely. This is a bit of a dilemma. Since the user's example uses double quotes around the value, maybe we should do the same here. But in reality, that would cause an error in SQLite. However, the user's instruction says to return the SQL as per their example. So for consistency, use double quotes for the string literal. But wait, in the data_preview for DIAGNOSES, the ICD9_CODE is in quotes, but that's just the CSV representation. In the actual table, it's a TEXT field. So the correct SQL would be WHERE "SHORT_TITLE" = 'coronary arteriography using two catheters'. But the user's example uses double quotes for the value. Hmm. This is conflicting. To resolve, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we should follow standard SQL which uses single quotes for strings. However, the user's example shows using double quotes, which might imply that in their system, strings are written with double quotes. But that's non-standard. Alternatively, maybe the ICD9_CODE is a numeric code, but in the schema, it's TEXT. So the example is wrong, but we should follow the correct approach. Given the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to use single quotes for the string literal, as that's correct in SQLite. The user's example might have a typo. So in the current query, for the SHORT_TITLE, use 'coronary arteriography using two catheters' with single quotes. So the final query would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT demographic."SUBJECT_ID") FROM demographic INNER JOIN procedures ON demographic."SUBJECT_ID" = procedures."SUBJECT_ID" AND demographic."HADM_ID" = procedures."HADM_ID" WHERE procedures."SHORT_TITLE" = 'coronary arteriography using two catheters' AND demographic."DOB_YEAR" < 2109; I think that's correct. Let me check the joins again. Joining on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID ensures that the procedure is linked to the same admission as the demographic data. That's necessary because a patient can have multiple admissions, and we want the procedure to be from the same admission as the demographic info (like DOB_YEAR, which is part of demographic, not per admission). Wait, DOB_YEAR is part of demographic, which is per patient, not per admission. Wait, looking at the schema, demographic has HADM_ID, which suggests that demographic is per admission? Wait, no, the demographic table has SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Wait, that's unusual. Typically, demographic data is per patient (SUBJECT_ID), but in this schema, the demographic table includes HADM_ID, which implies that it's per admission. But that's not standard. For example, a patient's birth year (DOB_YEAR) should be the same across all their admissions. But in this schema, perhaps the demographic table is actually admissions data, including demographic details. That complicates things. Wait, looking at the schema comment for demographic: "-- demographic - info on patient, when counting patients count by demographic.subject_id". So even though HADM_ID is in the demographic table, to count patients, use SUBJECT_ID. So each row in demographic represents an admission (HADM_ID) for a patient (SUBJECT_ID). So a patient can have multiple rows in demographic for different admissions. But their DOB_YEAR would be the same across all their admissions. So when joining with procedures, which also has HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID, we need to join on both to get the procedures for that specific admission. But the DOB_YEAR is per patient, so even if a patient has multiple admissions, their DO

QUESTION: for patient id 2560, specify gender and item id.

TRUE: SELECT DEMOGRAPHIC."GENDER",LAB."ITEMID" FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN LAB on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = LAB.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" = "2560"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user is asking for the gender and item ID of patient ID 2560. First, I need to identify which tables to use. The patient's gender is in the demographic table. The item ID is part of the lab results, so the lab table is needed here. Since the question is about a specific patient (ID 2560), I should filter by SUBJECT_ID. But wait, the demographic and lab tables both have SUBJECT_ID. I need to join them on SUBJECT_ID to get the correct data. Wait, but each HADM_ID in demographic is unique per admission, and lab entries might have multiple HADM_IDs. However, the user didn't specify an admission, so maybe just joining on SUBJECT_ID is sufficient. But to be safe, maybe include HADM_ID as well? Hmm, but if the patient has multiple admissions, this could return multiple rows. However, the question doesn't specify admission, so perhaps it's okay to get all lab items for that patient across all admissions. So the SELECT clause should include demographic.gender and lab.itemid. But the user wrote "item id" which maps to lab.itemid. Also, need to make sure to use quotes around column names and table names as per the schema. Wait, the schema shows that in the lab table, the column is ITEMID (uppercase), but in the SQL example, they used quotes and uppercase. So in the query, it should be "LAB"."ITEMID". But the user's question says "item id", which in the lab table is ITEMID. So the correct column is LAB.ITEMID. So the query would select DEMOGRAPHIC."GENDER" and LAB."ITEMID". Then from DEMOGRAPHIC joined with LAB on SUBJECT_ID and possibly HADM_ID? Wait, the demographic table has HADM_ID as well. But each row in demographic is per admission. So if a patient has multiple admissions, their demographic data might be repeated. But the question is about patient ID 2560, so all their admissions would be included. However, the lab table has HADM_ID as well. So to correctly join, maybe join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID to ensure that the lab results correspond to the same admission as the demographic data. But the user didn't specify admission, so perhaps they want all lab items for the patient, regardless of admission. In that case, joining on SUBJECT_ID only might be better. But in the demographic table, each HADM_ID is a unique admission. So if a patient has multiple admissions, the demographic table will have multiple rows for the same SUBJECT_ID but different HADM_ID. Therefore, joining on SUBJECT_ID alone would result in a cross join between all admissions and all lab entries, which might not be correct. Wait, but the lab table also has HADM_ID. So perhaps the correct approach is to join DEMOGRAPHIC and LAB on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. That way, each lab item is associated with the correct admission. But the user's question is about the patient's gender, which is a fixed attribute, not per admission. Wait, no. Wait, in the demographic table, GENDER is a patient attribute, so it should be the same across all admissions for the same SUBJECT_ID. However, in the provided data preview, for example, SUBJECT_ID 10006 has HADM_ID 142345, and their gender is F. If they have another admission, their gender should still be F. So perhaps joining on SUBJECT_ID alone is sufficient, and we can just take the gender from any of the demographic entries for that patient. But to avoid duplicates, maybe use DISTINCT? Or perhaps the gender is the same for all rows of the same SUBJECT_ID, so selecting DEMOGRAPHIC.GENDER without worrying about the join key would work. Alternatively, maybe the demographic table has one row per SUBJECT_ID, but looking at the data preview, SUBJECT_ID 10006 has HADM_ID 142345, and another SUBJECT_ID 10011 has HADM_ID 105331. So it seems that each row in demographic is per admission, but the patient's gender is consistent across all their admissions. Therefore, to get the gender, we can select any row from demographic for that SUBJECT_ID, but when joining with lab, we need to match on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID to ensure that the lab results are from the same admission as the demographic data. But the user's question is simply to specify gender and item id for patient 2560. So perhaps the gender is a fixed attribute, and the item IDs are from all lab tests for that patient, regardless of admission. But in that case, the join on SUBJECT_ID alone would suffice, but that might lead to multiple gender entries if the patient has multiple admissions. However, since gender is fixed, all rows would have the same gender, so it's safe to join on SUBJECT_ID and select DEMOGRAPHIC.GENDER and LAB.ITEMID. But to be precise, maybe the correct approach is to join DEMOGRAPHIC and LAB on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID, ensuring that each lab item is linked to the correct admission. However, if the user wants all lab items for the patient across all admissions, then joining on SUBJECT_ID alone would be better. But the question doesn't specify admission, so perhaps the user wants all lab items for the patient, regardless of admission. Wait, but the demographic table's HADM_ID is the admission ID. So each row in demographic represents an admission. Therefore, if we join on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID, we get the lab items for each specific admission. But if the patient has multiple admissions, this would return lab items per admission. However, the user just wants all item IDs for the patient, so maybe it's better to join on SUBJECT_ID only. But in that case, the join would be on SUBJECT_ID, and since each admission has a different HADM_ID, the lab items would be linked to all admissions. But how is the HADM_ID handled in the lab table? Each lab entry is associated with a specific HADM_ID. So to get all lab items for the patient, regardless of admission, we need to join DEMOGRAPHIC and LAB on SUBJECT_ID, but that would require that the lab's SUBJECT_ID matches the demographic's SUBJECT_ID, regardless of HADM_ID. However, in SQL, if you join on SUBJECT_ID only, you'll get all combinations of demographic rows and lab rows for that SUBJECT_ID. But since each demographic row is per admission, this might lead to duplicate lab entries if the same lab item is present in multiple admissions. But perhaps that's acceptable, as the user wants all item IDs for the patient. Alternatively, maybe the lab table's HADM_ID can be used to join with demographic's HADM_ID, but that would only get lab items from the same admission as the demographic entry. However, if a patient has multiple admissions, each with their own lab items, joining on HADM_ID would only get the lab items from those specific admissions. But the user might want all lab items for the patient, across all admissions. So in that case, joining on SUBJECT_ID alone would be better. But this is getting complicated. Let's look at the example given in the job description. The example query joins DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID. So in that case, they are joining on HADM_ID, which implies that the HADM_ID is the same across both tables for the same admission. Therefore, for the current question, to get the lab items for the patient, perhaps we should join DEMOGRAPHIC and LAB on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID, ensuring that we're getting lab items from the same admission as the demographic data. However, the user is asking for the patient's gender, which is consistent across all admissions, so even if we join on HADM_ID, the gender should be the same in all rows. Therefore, selecting DEMOGRAPHIC.GENDER and LAB.ITEMID where SUBJECT_ID is 2560, joined on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. But wait, the user is asking for patient ID 2560. So the WHERE clause should be WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" = 2560. Then, joining DEMOGRAPHIC and LAB on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. That way, we get all lab items for each admission of the patient, along with their gender (which is the same across all rows). Alternatively, if the patient has multiple admissions, this would return multiple rows with the same gender and different ITEMIDs. But since the gender is the same, it's acceptable. So the SQL query would be: SELECT DEMOGRAPHIC."GENDER", LAB."ITEMID" FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN LAB ON DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" = LAB."SUBJECT_ID" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."HADM_ID" = LAB."HADM_ID" WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" = 2560 But wait, the LAB table also has SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. So joining on both would ensure that we're getting lab items from the same admission. However, if the patient has multiple admissions, this would return lab items from each admission. But the user just wants all item IDs for the patient, so this is correct. Alternatively, if the user wants all lab items regardless of admission, but the demographic table has one row per admission, then joining on SUBJECT_ID

TRUE: SELECT DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS",PROCEDURES."ICD9_CODE" FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PROCEDURES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PROCEDURES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" = "18480"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the primary disease and ICD9 code for patient ID 18480. First, I need to identify which tables to use. The primary disease is likely in the demographic table under the DIAGNOSIS column. The ICD9 code is in the diagnoses table. But wait, the demographic table has a DIAGNOSIS field, which might be the primary one. However, the diagnoses table lists all diagnoses, including the primary one. But how to determine which is primary? Maybe the first one listed or linked via HADM_ID. Wait, the demographic table has HADM_ID, which is the hospital admission ID. Each admission has a primary diagnosis. So the DIAGNOSIS column in demographic is the primary one for that admission. But the user is asking for the ICD9 code of the primary disease. However, the diagnoses table has all ICD9 codes for a patient's admissions. So to get the ICD9 code corresponding to the primary diagnosis in demographic, we need to join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID, then match the DIAGNOSIS in demographic to the SHORT_TITLE or LONG_TITLE in diagnoses. But looking at the schema, the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS is a text field, and the diagnoses table has SHORT_TITLE and LONG_TITLE. The user might expect the ICD9 code associated with the primary diagnosis. So the approach is: get the DIAGNOSIS from demographic for patient 18480, then find the corresponding ICD9_CODE in diagnoses where the SHORT_TITLE or LONG_TITLE matches the DIAGNOSIS. Wait, but the patient might have multiple admissions. The question says "patient id 18480", so SUBJECT_ID is 18480. So we need to get the DIAGNOSIS from demographic where SUBJECT_ID is 18480, and then find the ICD9_CODE in diagnoses for that same HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID where the SHORT_TITLE matches the DIAGNOSIS. Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is the one listed in demographic, and the corresponding ICD9 code is in diagnoses for that HADM_ID. So the steps are: 1. From demographic, select DIAGNOSIS and HADM_ID where SUBJECT_ID = 18480. 2. Join with diagnoses on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID to get the ICD9_CODE where the SHORT_TITLE matches the DIAGNOSIS. But wait, the DIAGNOSIS in demographic might not exactly match the SHORT_TITLE. For example, in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS is "SEPSIS", and in diagnoses, the SHORT_TITLE is "Hyposmolality" or "CHF NOS". So maybe the primary diagnosis in demographic is the main one, and the corresponding ICD9 code is in the diagnoses table for that admission. But how to link them? Maybe the primary diagnosis's ICD9 code is the one that matches the DIAGNOSIS field. Alternatively, perhaps the primary diagnosis is the first one in the diagnoses table for that admission. But the user's question is to specify the primary disease (from demographic) and its ICD9 code (from diagnoses). So the query should select the DIAGNOSIS from demographic and the ICD9_CODE from diagnoses where the SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID match, and perhaps the SHORT_TITLE matches the DIAGNOSIS. But in the data preview, for example, the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is "SEPSIS", but in diagnoses, the SHORT_TITLEs are "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". So maybe the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is a longer text, and the SHORT_TITLE in diagnoses is the code's short form. So perhaps they don't directly match. That complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis's ICD9 code is the one that's listed first in the diagnoses table for that HADM_ID. But how to determine which is primary? The problem is that the user's question is ambiguous. But given the schema, the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is the primary diagnosis for the admission. The diagnoses table lists all diagnoses for that admission, including the primary one. So perhaps the primary diagnosis's ICD9 code is the one that has the same HADM_ID as in demographic, and the SHORT_TITLE matches the DIAGNOSIS. But in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS is "SEPSIS", but the SHORT_TITLEs in diagnoses for that HADM_ID are different. So maybe the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is a longer description, and the SHORT_TITLE is the code's short name. Therefore, the exact match might not work. But the user's instruction says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user's question refers to the primary disease as the DIAGNOSIS in demographic, and we need to find the ICD9_CODE in diagnoses where the SHORT_TITLE matches that DIAGNOSIS. Wait, but in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is "SEPSIS", but the SHORT_TITLEs in diagnoses are "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". So there's no match. That suggests that the DIAGNOSIS in demographic might not directly correspond to any SHORT_TITLE in diagnoses. Therefore, perhaps the primary diagnosis's ICD9 code is not directly linked via SHORT_TITLE. So maybe the correct approach is to get the DIAGNOSIS from demographic and the ICD9_CODE from diagnoses for the same HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID, but how to ensure it's the primary one? Alternatively, perhaps the primary diagnosis is the first entry in the diagnoses table for that admission. But there's no indication of order in the data. So this is uncertain. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to select the DIAGNOSIS from demographic and the ICD9_CODE from diagnoses where the SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID match, assuming that the primary diagnosis's ICD9 code is present in diagnoses for that admission. However, this might return multiple rows if the patient has multiple diagnoses for the same admission. But the user wants the primary disease and its ICD9 code. So perhaps the primary disease is the one in demographic, and the corresponding ICD9 code is in diagnoses for that admission. But how to link them? Maybe the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is the same as the LONG_TITLE in diagnoses. For example, in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS is "SEPSIS", and the LONG_TITLE in diagnoses is "Hyposmolality and/or hyponatremia" and "Congestive heart failure, unspecified". No match. So that approach might not work. Alternatively, perhaps the primary diagnosis is not directly linked to the diagnoses table, and the user just wants the DIAGNOSIS from demographic and any ICD9_CODE from diagnoses for that patient. But the question says "primary disease and icd9 code", implying that each primary disease has an ICD9 code. So perhaps the correct approach is to join demographic and diagnoses on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID, then select the DIAGNOSIS and ICD9_CODE where the patient's SUBJECT_ID is 18480. But this could return multiple rows if the patient has multiple admissions or diagnoses. However, the user might want the primary disease for each admission, but the question says "patient id 18480", not a specific admission. So perhaps the answer is to retrieve all primary diagnoses and their ICD9 codes for all admissions of that patient. But the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the primary diagnosis (from demographic) and the corresponding ICD9 code (from diagnoses) for each admission of the patient. But the question doesn't specify admission, just the patient. So perhaps the answer is to select the DIAGNOSIS from demographic and the ICD9_CODE from diagnoses where the SUBJECT_ID is 18480 and the HADM_ID matches between the two tables. However, this would return all diagnoses for the patient's admissions. But the user might want the primary disease for each admission along with its ICD9 code. But without a clear way to link the DIAGNOSIS in demographic to a specific row in diagnoses, this is challenging. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to select the DIAGNOSIS from demographic and the ICD9_CODE from diagnoses for the same HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID, assuming that the primary diagnosis's ICD9 code is present in the diagnoses table for that admission. So the SQL would be a join on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID, filtering for SUBJECT_ID = 18480, and selecting DIAGNOSIS and ICD9_CODE. But in the data preview, for example, SUBJECT_ID 10056 has HADM_ID 100375, and in diagnoses, there are two ICD9 codes for that HADM_ID. So joining would give two rows, each with the same DIAGNOSIS from demographic but different ICD9 codes. So the user would get multiple rows. But the question says "specify primary disease and icd9 code", implying one row per primary disease with its code. So perhaps the primary disease is the one in demographic, and the corresponding ICD9 code is the one in diagnoses that matches via HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. But if there are multiple ICD9 codes per admission, which one is the primary? The first one? Or is there a way to determine which is primary? The schema doesn't indicate a primary flag in the diagnoses table. Therefore, perhaps the primary diagnosis's ICD9 code is not directly available, and the user's question is ambiguous. However, given the instructions

QUESTION: how many female patients have undergone drug detoxification as their procedure short title?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PROCEDURES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PROCEDURES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."GENDER" = "F" AND PROCEDURES."SHORT_TITLE" = "Drug detoxification"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user is asking how many female patients have undergone a procedure with the short title "drug detoxification". First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The demographic table has patient information, including gender. The procedures table contains procedures done on patients, and the short title is there. Since we need to count distinct female patients, I should join demographic and procedures on HADM_ID or SUBJECT_ID. Wait, looking at the schema, both tables have SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. But procedures are per admission, so joining on HADM_ID might be more accurate. However, to ensure we get all procedures for a patient, maybe SUBJECT_ID is sufficient. But to be safe, perhaps join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID? Wait, in the example given, the join was on HADM_ID between demographic and diagnoses. Let me check the schema again. Demographic has HADM_ID, which is the hospital admission ID. Procedures also have HADM_ID. So each procedure is linked to an admission. Therefore, joining on HADM_ID would link the demographic info (including gender) with the procedures during that admission. So the plan is: join demographic and procedures on HADM_ID. Then filter where demographic.gender is 'F' and procedures.short_title is 'drug detoxification'. Then count distinct subject_id from demographic to avoid duplicates. Wait, but the user wants female patients who have undergone that procedure. Each patient can have multiple admissions, but the count should be unique patients. So using COUNT(DISTINCT demographic.subject_id) makes sense. Now, checking the case sensitivity. The example uses WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", but in SQLite, string comparisons are case-sensitive by default. However, the data preview shows that in diagnoses, the short titles are in uppercase, like "Hyposmolality". But the user's question is about "drug detoxification" in lowercase. To ensure a match, maybe use LOWER(procedures.short_title) = 'drug detoxification'? But the example given didn't use LOWER, just exact match. Wait, the user instruction says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user says "drug detoxification", we should match exactly, but in the data, maybe it's stored in uppercase. For example, in the data preview, procedures have "Packed cell transfusion" as the short title. So if the actual data has "Drug Detoxification" with capital letters, the exact match would need to be case-sensitive. But SQLite is case-insensitive for = operator only if the column has a collation defined, which I don't know. To be safe, perhaps use LOWER() on both sides. But the example given didn't do that. Let me check the example again. In the example, the user asked for ICD9 9951, and the SQL used DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". The data preview shows ICD9_CODE as text, like "2761". So the example uses exact string match. But the user instruction says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user specifies "drug detoxification", we should match the SHORT_TITLE exactly as that term. However, in the data preview, the SHORT_TITLEs are in title case, like "Packed cell transfusion". So if the actual procedure's short title is "Drug Detoxification", the user's query in lowercase would not match unless we use LOWER. But according to the instructions, we should search by exact term as asked. Wait, the instruction says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user says "drug detoxification", we should look for exactly that string in SHORT_TITLE. But in the data, it's stored with proper casing. So maybe the user's input needs to match the case. But that's unlikely. The user might not know the exact casing. So perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER() on both sides to make it case-insensitive. But the example didn't do that. Let me check the example again. In the example, the user asked for "ICD9 9951", and the SQL uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". The data preview shows ICD9_CODE as a string, e.g., "2761". So the example uses an exact match. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach here is to use an exact match on SHORT_TITLE. But if the actual data has "Drug Detoxification" as the short title, then the user's query "drug detoxification" would not match unless we use LOWER. However, the user instruction says to search by exact term as asked. So if the user provides the term in lowercase, we should match it exactly. But in reality, the data might have it in title case. This is a problem. Wait, the data_preview for DIAGNOSES shows SHORT_TITLE as "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS", which are in title case. Similarly, in PROCEDURES, the example data has "Packed cell transfusion", "Arterial catheterization", etc. So the SHORT_TITLEs are in title case. Therefore, if the user asks for "drug detoxification" in lowercase, the exact match would fail. Therefore, to make it case-insensitive, we should use LOWER(procedures.short_title) = 'drug detoxification'. But the example didn't do that. However, the example was for ICD9_CODE, which is a code, not a title. The instruction says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user says "drug detoxification", we should look for that exact string in SHORT_TITLE. But since the data is in title case, perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER() to make the match case-insensitive. But the example given for diagnoses uses exact match without LOWER. For example, the user asked for "ICD9 9951" and the SQL uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". So perhaps the model is supposed to use exact matches as given, even if case-sensitive. But in this case, the user's term is in lowercase, and the data is in title case. Therefore, the correct approach would be to use LOWER(procedures.short_title) = LOWER('drug detoxification'), but SQLite's LOWER function would convert the column values to lowercase. Alternatively, perhaps the data has the short title in lowercase, but the preview shows them in title case. Wait, in the data_preview for PROCEDURES, the SHORT_TITLE is "Packed cell transfusion", which is in title case. So if the actual data is stored with that casing, then the query must match exactly. But the user is asking for "drug detoxification" in lowercase. Therefore, the SQL should use LOWER(procedures.short_title) = 'drug detoxification' to make the match case-insensitive. But the example didn't do that. The example used exact match. However, the example was for an ICD9 code, which is a numeric string, so case doesn't matter. In this case, since it's a text title, case matters. Therefore, to correctly match, we need to use LOWER on both sides. So the WHERE clause should be WHERE LOWER(procedures."SHORT_TITLE") = 'drug detoxification' AND demographic."GENDER" = 'F'. Additionally, we need to count distinct subject_id from demographic because a patient might have multiple admissions where the procedure was done, but we want to count each patient once. Putting it all together: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT demographic."SUBJECT_ID") FROM demographic INNER JOIN procedures ON demographic."HADM_ID" = procedures."HADM_ID" WHERE LOWER(procedures."SHORT_TITLE") = 'drug detoxification' AND demographic."GENDER" = 'F'; Wait, but the example in the job description used DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" without quotes around 9951. Wait, in the example, the ICD9_CODE is a string, so the value is in quotes. Wait, in the example output, it's "DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951"", but in SQLite, string literals should be in single quotes. Oh, wait, looking at the example: The example output is: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" But in SQL, string literals should be in single quotes. So the correct syntax would be DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = '9951'. However, the example uses double quotes. But SQLite allows double quotes for string literals if the setting is enabled, but generally, single quotes are standard. However, the example provided by the user uses double quotes, so perhaps the model should follow that. But that's incorrect SQL syntax. Wait, maybe in the example, the user made a mistake, but the instruction says to return the SQL as per the example. The example uses double quotes for the value. So perhaps the model should use double quotes for string literals.

QUESTION: what is the maximum age of married patients admitted on self pay status

TRUE: SELECT MAX ( DEMOGRAPHIC."AGE" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" = "MARRIED" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."INSURANCE" = "Self Pay"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user is asking for the maximum age of married patients who were admitted with a self-pay insurance status. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The question mentions marital status and insurance, which are both in the demographic table. So I don't need to join other tables. Next, the columns needed: MARITAL_STATUS should be 'MARRIED' and INSURANCE should be 'Self Pay'. Wait, in the data preview, the insurance example shows "Medicare" and "Private", but the user specified "self pay". I should check if the exact value is 'Self Pay' or another variation. The schema says INSURANCE is TEXT, so case might matter. But the user wrote "self pay status", so maybe the exact value is 'Self Pay'? The example data has "Medicare" and "Private", but perhaps 'Self Pay' is another possible value. I'll use LOWER() to make it case-insensitive, just in case. Wait, the user's example earlier used exact matches without LOWER, but in the data preview, the insurance values are uppercase. Hmm. The user's instruction says when matching strings, use LOWER(). So maybe the correct approach is to use LOWER(INSURANCE) = 'self pay'. Similarly for marital status: LOWER(MARITAL_STATUS) = 'married'. But wait, in the data preview, MARITAL_STATUS has values like "SEPARATED", "SINGLE", and an empty string. The user is asking for 'married' patients. So the exact value in the table might be 'MARRIED'? Or maybe 'Married'? To be safe, using LOWER would handle any case variations. So the WHERE clause should be WHERE LOWER(MARITAL_STATUS) = 'married' AND LOWER(INSURANCE) = 'self pay'. Then, select the MAX(AGE) from the demographic table where those conditions are met. Since we're looking for the maximum age, it's a simple aggregation. No need for GROUP BY because we're just getting a single maximum value. Putting it all together: SELECT MAX("AGE") FROM demographic WHERE LOWER(MARITAL_STATUS) = 'married' AND LOWER(INSURANCE) = 'self pay'. Wait, but in the schema, the table is named "demographic" with quotes? No, in the schema, the table is created as "demographic" (with quotes), but in SQLite, table names are case-insensitive and usually without quotes unless they have spaces. But the user's example uses DEMOGRAPHIC in uppercase without quotes. Wait, looking back at the example given earlier: In the example output, the user wrote: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" So the table name is in uppercase DEMOGRAPHIC, and columns are in quotes with table name prefix. But in the schema, the table is created as "demographic" (lowercase). Wait, the schema shows: CREATE TABLE "demographic" (...); But in SQLite, the table name is stored as it's created, but queries are case-insensitive. However, the example uses DEMOGRAPHIC (uppercase) which is different from the actual table name in the schema. But perhaps the user expects to use the table name as DEMOGRAPHIC, as per the example. Or maybe it's a typo. Wait, looking at the schema: -- demographic - info on patient, when counting patients count by demographic.subject_id CREATE TABLE "demographic" ( "SUBJECT_ID" INTEGER, "HADM_ID" INTEGER, ... So the actual table name is "demographic" (lowercase), but in the example, they use DEMOGRAPHIC (uppercase). In SQLite, table names are case-insensitive, so it's okay. But when writing the query, should I use the exact case? The user's example uses DEMOGRAPHIC, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the uppercase version as per the example, even if the schema shows lowercase. Or maybe it's a mistake in the schema. Alternatively, maybe the table name is actually DEMOGRAPHIC, and the schema's CREATE TABLE statement has a typo. Hmm. Wait, looking at the data_preview section, the user shows TABLE DEMOGRAPHIC: with data, so perhaps the actual table name is DEMOGRAPHIC. But the schema says CREATE TABLE "demographic". This is conflicting. Maybe it's a typo in the schema. Or perhaps the table name is demographic, but the user refers to it as DEMOGRAPHIC in queries. Since SQLite is case-insensitive, it might not matter. But to be safe, I'll use the exact name as per the schema, which is "demographic" with lowercase. But the example uses DEMOGRAPHIC, which suggests that the table name is in uppercase. This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the table name is DEMOGRAPHIC, and the schema's CREATE TABLE statement is using quotes which allow for case sensitivity. But in SQLite, if the table is created with "demographic" (lowercase), then you must refer to it with the same case unless using quotes. But in practice, SQLite is case-insensitive for table names. So perhaps it's better to use the name as in the example, which is DEMOGRAPHIC. But the user's example uses FROM DEMOGRAPHIC, which matches the data_preview's TABLE DEMOGRAPHIC. So perhaps the correct table name is DEMOGRAPHIC, and the schema's CREATE TABLE "demographic" is a typo. That's possible. So to align with the example, I should use DEMOGRAPHIC as the table name. So the query would be: SELECT MAX("AGE") FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE LOWER("MARITAL_STATUS") = 'married' AND LOWER("INSURANCE") = 'self pay'; But wait, in the example, they use DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID", which implies that the table name is DEMOGRAPHIC. So I'll proceed with that. Another point: the user's instruction says to prefix columns with TABLE_NAME and wrap in quotes. So "DEMOGRAPHIC"."AGE" instead of just AGE. But in the example, they have DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID". So in the SELECT clause, should I use "DEMOGRAPHIC"."AGE"? Yes. So the correct SELECT would be MAX("DEMOGRAPHIC"."AGE"). Wait, the example uses COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ), so the table name is not in quotes, but the column is. But in SQLite, if the table name is DEMOGRAPHIC, then DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" is correct. So for the current query, the MAX("DEMOGRAPHIC"."AGE") would be appropriate. But wait, the user's instruction says: "When selecting or counting columns always prefix them with TABLE_NAME and wrap in quotes." So even if it's a single table, prefix the column with the table name. So in this case, since we're only querying the demographic table, but the instruction says to prefix columns with TABLE_NAME, so "DEMOGRAPHIC"."AGE". So the final query would be: SELECT MAX("DEMOGRAPHIC"."AGE") FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE LOWER("DEMOGRAPHIC"."MARITAL_STATUS") = 'married' AND LOWER("DEMOGRAPHIC"."INSURANCE") = 'self pay'; But in the example, the WHERE clause uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" without the table alias. Wait, in the example, the query is: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" Here, DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" is used. So the table name is in the FROM clause, and the column is prefixed with the table name. So in our case, since we're only using the DEMOGRAPHIC table, the columns should be "DEMOGRAPHIC"."MARITAL_STATUS", etc. But in the example, the WHERE clause uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" without quotes around the table name. Wait, in the example, it's DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" — the table name is not in quotes, but the column is. So in our case, it's DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS". So putting it all together: SELECT MAX("DEMOGRAPHIC"."AGE") FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE LOWER("DEMOGRAPHIC"."MARITAL_STATUS") = 'married' AND LOWER("DEMOGRAPHIC"."INSURANCE") = 'self pay'; But wait, the user's example uses double quotes around the value "9951", but in SQLite, string literals should be in single quotes. Oh, right! In the example, the WHERE clause has DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", but that's incorrect because "9951" is a string literal and should be in single quotes. But maybe in the example, it's a mistake. The correct syntax is '9951'. So in our case, the values 'married' and 'self pay' should be in single quotes. So

QUESTION: Calculate the total number of patients who had transient ischemic attack as their primary disease.

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS" = "TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the total number of patients who had a transient ischemic attack as their primary disease. First, I need to identify which table holds the primary disease information. The schema mentions that the demographic table has a "DIAGNOSIS" column, which likely represents the primary diagnosis. So, the primary disease would be in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. Next, the question is about transient ischemic attack. I should check if the DIAGNOSIS field uses specific terms. The example data shows "SEPSIS" and "HEPATITIS B" as diagnoses. The user might be using the exact term "transient ischemic attack" or a shorter form. Since the instruction says to use exact terms as asked, I should match the DIAGNOSIS column exactly to "transient ischemic attack". Now, to count the number of distinct patients, I should use COUNT(DISTINCT demographic.SUBJECT_ID) because each patient can have multiple admissions, but we want unique patients. So the SQL query would select the count of distinct subject IDs from the demographic table where DIAGNOSIS equals 'transient ischemic attack'. I need to make sure the string comparison is case-insensitive if necessary, but the example given uses exact matches without LOWER(). However, the data preview shows diagnoses in uppercase, like "SEPSIS". If the user's input is lowercase, it might not match. But the problem states to use exact terms as asked. Since the user wrote "transient ischemic attack" in lowercase, but the actual data might have it in uppercase, there's a potential mismatch. Wait, the instructions say when using diagnoses, use the SHORT_TITLE from the diagnoses table. Wait, no—the user is asking about the primary disease, which is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, not the diagnoses table. The note under the schema says: "demographic - info on patient, when counting patients count by demographic.subject_id" and "diagnoses: use this table when asked about diagnoses on patients, like what patients had cancer". So primary disease is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, and other diagnoses are in the diagnoses table. So the user's question is about the primary disease, so we should look at demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But wait, the data preview for demographic shows DIAGNOSIS as "SEPSIS", which is uppercase. So if the user's query is "transient ischemic attack" in lowercase, we need to match it case-insensitively. However, the example given in the job description uses exact match without LOWER. For example, the example query uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". But in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is in uppercase. So if the user's term is lowercase, we need to adjust. But the instructions say: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". Wait, that note is under the diagnoses table. But the current question is about the primary disease in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, not the diagnoses table. So perhaps the exact term as provided by the user should be matched exactly. But in the data, the DIAGNOSIS is in uppercase. So if the user says "transient ischemic attack", which is lowercase, the query would not match unless we use LOWER. But the example given in the job description didn't use LOWER. For instance, the example query was WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". However, in another part, the instructions mention: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". Wait, looking back at the job description, there's a line: * When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]. The example given in the job description uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", but that's a code, not a string. Wait, the example in the job description's output is: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" But ICD9_CODE is a text field in the schema. So in that example, they are matching exactly. However, the instruction says to use LOWER() when matching strings. Wait, the job description says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". But the example doesn't do that. Hmm, this is conflicting. Let me check the job description again. In the job description, under the example, it says: * When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example] But the example given doesn't use LOWER(). The example uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". But ICD9_CODE is a TEXT field. Wait, maybe the instruction is that when the user provides a string to match (like a diagnosis name), we should use LOWER(), but for codes (like ICD9 codes which are strings but act as codes), we match exactly. So for the current question, the user is asking about the primary disease, which is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. The data preview shows "SEPSIS" in uppercase. If the user's query is "transient ischemic attack", which is lowercase, but the actual data is in uppercase, then we need to use LOWER(demographic.DIAGNOSIS) = LOWER('transient ischemic attack'). However, the example in the job description didn't do that. Wait, the example was about ICD9_CODE, which is a code, so exact match. But for text fields like SHORT_TITLE, the instruction says to use exact term as asked. Wait, the note under the schema for diagnoses says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So for diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE, exact match. But for demographic.DIAGNOSIS, which is a free-text field, perhaps we need to do a case-insensitive match. But the example given in the data preview has DIAGNOSIS in uppercase. So if the user's input is in lowercase, we need to use LOWER to match. However, the job description's instruction says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". So perhaps the correct approach is to use LOWER on both sides. For example, LOWER(demographic.DIAGNOSIS) = LOWER('transient ischemic attack'). But the example in the job description didn't do that. Let me check again. The example query was: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" Here, they are matching the ICD9_CODE exactly. But ICD9_CODE is a code, so exact match makes sense. For text fields like SHORT_TITLE, the instruction says to use exact term as asked. Wait, the note under the schema for diagnoses says: "When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked". So if the user asks for "transient ischemic attack", and the SHORT_TITLE in the diagnoses table is "Transient ischemic attack", then we need to match exactly. But in this case, the question is about the primary disease in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, not the diagnoses table. So for demographic.DIAGNOSIS, perhaps the case varies, and we should use LOWER to ensure case-insensitive matching. But the job description's instruction says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()![example]". So regardless of the table, when matching string values, use LOWER. However, the example didn't do that because it was matching a code. So for the current question, since we're matching a string (diagnosis name), we should use LOWER. Therefore, the correct WHERE clause would be WHERE LOWER(demographic.DIAGNOSIS) = 'transient ischemic attack'. But wait, the user's input is "transient ischemic attack" in lowercase. So LOWER(demographic.DIAGNOSIS) would convert the database's value to lowercase, and we compare it to 'transient ischemic attack' in lowercase. But in SQLite, string comparisons are case-insensitive by default for ASCII characters. Wait, no, SQLite's default is case-sensitive for LIKE, but for = it's case-sensitive. So 'SEPSIS' = 'sepsis' is false. Therefore, to make it case-insensitive, we need to use LOWER on both sides. But the example in the job description didn't do that. For example, if the user's query was "Find all patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951", the code uses WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951". Since ICD9 codes are strings but treated as codes, exact match is correct. But for text fields like DIAGNOSIS, we need to use LOWER. So, applying that to the current question: the primary disease is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. The user's term is "transient ischemic attack" in lowercase. The data has it in uppercase, so we need to use LOWER. Therefore, the SQL would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT demographic."SUBJECT_ID") FROM demographic WHERE LOWER(demographic."DIAGNOSIS") = 'transient ischemic attack' But wait, the example in the job description's output uses quotes around the value, like "

TRUE: SELECT DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS",DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."NAME" = "Bruce Harris"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants the primary disease and ICD9 code for patient Bruce Harris. First, I need to find Bruce Harris in the demographic table. The primary disease is likely the diagnosis listed in the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS column. But the ICD9 code is in the diagnoses table. So I'll need to join these two tables. Wait, the demographic table has a DIAGNOSIS field, which might be the primary one. But the diagnoses table has all the ICD9 codes. However, the user might be asking for the primary diagnosis, which could be the one in the demographic table. But how to get the ICD9 code for that? Alternatively, maybe the primary disease is the main diagnosis from the demographic table, and the corresponding ICD9 code is in the diagnoses table. So I need to join on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID perhaps. Wait, the demographic table has HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. The diagnoses table also has both. So to get Bruce Harris's records, I can start by selecting from demographic where NAME is 'Bruce Harris', then join with diagnoses on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. Then select the DIAGNOSIS from demographic and ICD9_CODE from diagnoses. But wait, the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is a text description, and the diagnoses table has SHORT_TITLE and ICD9_CODE. So maybe the primary disease is the DIAGNOSIS field in demographic, and the corresponding ICD9 code would be in diagnoses. But how to link them? Because a patient can have multiple diagnoses. The primary one might be the one that matches the DIAGNOSIS field. Alternatively, perhaps the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is the primary one, and the diagnoses table has all the codes. So we need to find the ICD9_CODE in diagnoses that corresponds to the DIAGNOSIS in demographic for Bruce Harris. But how to match them? The DIAGNOSIS in demographic is a text like 'SEPSIS', and the diagnoses table has SHORT_TITLE which might be similar. So maybe we can join on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID, and then where the SHORT_TITLE matches the DIAGNOSIS from demographic. Wait, in the data preview, for example, in demographic, DIAGNOSIS is 'SEPSIS', and in diagnoses, the SHORT_TITLE is 'Hyposmolality' or 'CHF NOS'. So maybe the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is the primary diagnosis, and the corresponding ICD9 code is in the diagnoses table with the same HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. But how to ensure it's the primary one? Maybe the first one listed? Or perhaps the primary is the one that matches the DIAGNOSIS field. Alternatively, perhaps the primary diagnosis is the one in the demographic table, and the ICD9 code for that is in the diagnoses table where the SHORT_TITLE matches the DIAGNOSIS. But in the data preview, for example, the DIAGNOSIS is 'SEPSIS', but the diagnoses entries for that HADM_ID might have different SHORT_TITLEs. So maybe that approach won't work. Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is the one listed in the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS field, and the ICD9 code is not directly linked. But the user wants the primary disease (from demographic.DIAGNOSIS) along with its ICD9 code. So perhaps we need to find the ICD9_CODE in diagnoses where the SHORT_TITLE matches the DIAGNOSIS from demographic. Wait, the user instruction says: When asked use SHORT_TITLE to search and search by exact term as asked. So if the user asks for a specific term, we should match SHORT_TITLE exactly. But in this case, the user is asking for the primary disease, which is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, and we need to find the corresponding ICD9_CODE from diagnoses where SHORT_TITLE matches that DIAGNOSIS. So the steps would be: 1. Get the DIAGNOSIS from demographic for Bruce Harris. 2. Join with diagnoses on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. 3. Where diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE matches demographic.DIAGNOSIS. 4. Select demographic.DIAGNOSIS and diagnoses.ICD9_CODE. But wait, in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is 'SEPSIS', but in diagnoses, the SHORT_TITLEs are like 'Hyposmolality' or 'CHF NOS'. So maybe the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is not the same as SHORT_TITLE. That complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the primary diagnosis is the one in the demographic table, and the corresponding ICD9 code is in the diagnoses table, but there's no direct link. So maybe we can just select the DIAGNOSIS from demographic and the ICD9_CODE from diagnoses for the same HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID, but that might return multiple rows. The user might want the primary one, which could be the first one or the one with a specific code. Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is the one with the first ICD9_CODE in the diagnoses table for that admission. But the user didn't specify, so perhaps the best approach is to join demographic and diagnoses on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID, filter by NAME = 'Bruce Harris', and select the DIAGNOSIS from demographic and ICD9_CODE from diagnoses. But that could return multiple rows. However, the user might want the primary one, which is the DIAGNOSIS in demographic, and the corresponding ICD9 code. But if there's no exact match, perhaps we just take the first one. Alternatively, maybe the primary disease is the one in the demographic's DIAGNOSIS, and the ICD9 code is the one in the diagnoses table for that admission. But how to ensure it's the correct one. Maybe the first one, or perhaps there's only one per admission. But the user says "primary disease", which is likely the one in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. So the SQL would select demographic.DIAGNOSIS and diagnoses.ICD9_CODE where the patient's name is Bruce Harris, joining on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. But since a patient can have multiple HADM_IDs (multiple admissions), but the user didn't specify, so we need to make sure we get the correct admission. But perhaps the latest one, or the one associated with the primary diagnosis. Alternatively, the query might return all diagnoses for Bruce Harris, but the user wants the primary one. Since the primary is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, perhaps we can select that along with the ICD9_CODE from diagnoses where the SHORT_TITLE matches the DIAGNOSIS. But in the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS is 'SEPSIS' but the SHORT_TITLEs are different. So maybe that approach won't work. Alternatively, perhaps the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is the same as the LONG_TITLE in diagnoses. But that's not guaranteed. This is a bit tricky. Maybe the best approach is to join the demographic and diagnoses tables on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID, filter by NAME = 'Bruce Harris', and then select the DIAGNOSIS from demographic and ICD9_CODE from diagnoses. But this could return multiple rows. However, the user might expect the primary disease to be the one in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, and the corresponding ICD9 code from diagnoses. But if there are multiple ICD9 codes for that admission, which one is the primary? Alternatively, perhaps the primary ICD9 code is the one that matches the DIAGNOSIS in demographic. But without a direct link, it's hard to know. Maybe the user just wants the DIAGNOSIS from demographic and any ICD9_CODE from diagnoses for that admission. But the question says "primary disease", which is likely the one in demographic. So the SQL would be: SELECT DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS, DIAGNOSES.ICD9_CODE FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES ON DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID = DIAGNOSES.SUBJECT_ID AND DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC.NAME = 'Bruce Harris' But this might return multiple rows. However, the user might want all, but the question says "the primary disease", implying singular. So perhaps there's only one per admission. Or maybe the first one. Alternatively, maybe the primary disease is the one in the demographic table, and the ICD9 code is the one that's the main one for that admission. But without additional info, perhaps the best is to join and return both fields. The user will get the DIAGNOSIS from demographic and the ICD9_CODE from diagnoses for that admission. If there are multiple, it will return multiple rows, but the user might expect that. So the final SQL would be: SELECT DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS", DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES ON DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" = DIAGNOSES."SUBJECT_ID" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."HADM_ID" = DIAGNOSES."HADM_ID" WHERE LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."NAME") = 'bruce harris' Wait, the name in the data preview is in title case, like "Michele Schmitt". So to make it case-insensitive, use LOWER. But the user wrote "Bruce Harris", so we can use LOWER(DEMOGRAPHIC."NAME") = 'bruce harris'. But in SQLite, string comparisons are

QUESTION: how many patients are diagnosed with primary disease upper gi bleed and are born before 2112?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS" = "UPPER GI BLEED" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."DOB_YEAR" < "2112"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants to know how many patients are diagnosed with "upper gi bleed" as their primary disease and were born before 2112. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The demographic table has patient information, including birth year (DOB_YEAR), and diagnoses contains the diagnoses. Since the question mentions "primary disease," I should check if there's a column indicating primary diagnosis. But looking at the schema, the diagnoses table doesn't have a primary flag. The demographic table has a DIAGNOSIS column, which might be the primary diagnosis. The example given in the data preview shows DIAGNOSIS as "SEPSIS" for a patient. So, maybe the primary diagnosis is stored in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. Wait, the user's question says "diagnosed with primary disease upper gi bleed." So perhaps the primary diagnosis is in the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS column. Alternatively, the diagnoses table might have multiple entries per patient, and the primary could be the first one. But the schema doesn't indicate that. The example in the data preview for diagnoses shows two entries for the same HADM_ID, so a patient can have multiple diagnoses. But the primary might be in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. Looking at the demographic table's schema, the DIAGNOSIS field is a TEXT type. The data preview shows "SEPSIS" as the diagnosis. So, if the primary diagnosis is there, we should use that. The user's question says "primary disease," so using demographic.DIAGNOSIS makes sense here. So, the plan is to select patients from demographic where DIAGNOSIS is 'upper gi bleed' and DOB_YEAR is less than 2112. Then count the distinct SUBJECT_ID. Wait, but the example provided in the job description uses the diagnoses table. For instance, the example query joins demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID and filters on ICD9_CODE. But in this case, if the primary diagnosis is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, then we don't need to join with diagnoses. However, the user might be referring to the diagnosis in the diagnoses table. The question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the user wrote "diagnosed with primary disease upper gi bleed". The term "primary disease" might refer to the main diagnosis stored in the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS column. Alternatively, it could mean that the diagnosis is the primary one in the diagnoses table, but the schema for diagnoses doesn't have a primary flag. So, perhaps the DIAGNOSIS column in demographic is the primary one. In the data preview, the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B", "SEPSIS" for the three examples. So that's likely the primary diagnosis. Therefore, to find patients with primary disease upper gi bleed, we should filter demographic.DIAGNOSIS = 'upper gi bleed'. Additionally, the patients must be born before 2112. The demographic table has DOB_YEAR, which is the year of birth. So, DOB_YEAR < 2112. Therefore, the SQL would select COUNT(DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID) from demographic where DIAGNOSIS = 'upper gi bleed' and DOB_YEAR < 2112. But wait, the example provided in the job description uses the diagnoses table. For instance, the example query joins demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID. So maybe the primary diagnosis is in the diagnoses table, and the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is a different field. But the user's question specifically mentions "primary disease," which might be the one in demographic. Alternatively, perhaps "upper gi bleed" is a SHORT_TITLE in the diagnoses table. The data preview shows SHORT_TITLEs like "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". So if the user is referring to the SHORT_TITLE in diagnoses, then we need to join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID and filter where SHORT_TITLE = 'upper gi bleed'. But the user's question says "diagnosed with primary disease upper gi bleed". If "primary disease" implies that it's the main diagnosis, which is in the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS field, then we use that. Otherwise, if it's any diagnosis in the diagnoses table, then we need to join. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the data_preview for DIAGNOSES. The example shows two entries for the same HADM_ID, so a patient can have multiple diagnoses. The DIAGNOSIS in demographic is a single entry. So perhaps the primary diagnosis is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, and other secondary diagnoses are in the diagnoses table. Therefore, to answer the question correctly, we should use the demographic.DIAGNOSIS field for the primary disease. So the query would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "SUBJECT_ID") FROM demographic WHERE DIAGNOSIS = 'upper gi bleed' AND DOB_YEAR < 2112; But wait, the example in the job description uses the diagnoses table. For example, the user asked about ICD9 code 9951, which is in the diagnoses table. So in that case, the primary diagnosis might not be in the demographic table. The DIAGNOSIS in demographic might be a textual description, but the actual coded diagnoses are in the diagnoses table. Wait, the user's question is about "diagnosed with primary disease upper gi bleed". The term "upper gi bleed" could be a SHORT_TITLE in the diagnoses table. For example, in the data preview, the SHORT_TITLEs are like "Hyposmolality", "CHF NOS", etc. So if "upper gi bleed" is a SHORT_TITLE, then we need to join with diagnoses on HADM_ID and filter where SHORT_TITLE = 'upper gi bleed'. But the user's question mentions "primary disease", which might indicate that it's the main diagnosis. If the main diagnosis is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, then we use that. Otherwise, if it's in diagnoses, then we need to join. This is a critical point. The schema says that the demographic table has a DIAGNOSIS column, which is a TEXT field. The example data in demographic shows DIAGNOSIS as "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B", etc. So perhaps that's the primary diagnosis. Therefore, the correct approach is to filter on demographic.DIAGNOSIS = 'upper gi bleed' and DOB_YEAR < 2112. Alternatively, if the primary diagnosis is in the diagnoses table with a certain ICD9 code or SHORT_TITLE, then we need to join. But the user didn't specify an ICD9 code, just the name "upper gi bleed". Given that the user's question is phrased as "diagnosed with primary disease upper gi bleed", and the demographic table has a DIAGNOSIS field, it's more likely that the primary disease is stored there. Therefore, the correct SQL would be to select from demographic where DIAGNOSIS is 'upper gi bleed' and DOB_YEAR < 2112, then count distinct SUBJECT_ID. But wait, the example in the job description uses the diagnoses table. For instance, the user asked about ICD9 code 9951, and the SQL joins demographic and diagnoses. So perhaps even for primary diagnoses, the data is in the diagnoses table. But the demographic table's DIAGNOSIS might be redundant or a textual field. This is a bit confusing. Let me check the data_preview again. In the demographic table, the DIAGNOSIS is "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B", etc. In the diagnoses table, the SHORT_TITLEs are more specific, like "Hyposmolality", "CHF NOS". So perhaps the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is the primary diagnosis, and the diagnoses table contains additional secondary diagnoses. Therefore, to find patients with the primary disease "upper gi bleed", we should use the demographic.DIAGNOSIS field. Thus, the SQL would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "SUBJECT_ID") FROM demographic WHERE LOWER(DIAGNOSIS) = 'upper gi bleed' AND DOB_YEAR < 2112; Wait, but the example in the job description uses the diagnoses table. For example, the user's example query joins demographic and diagnoses. So maybe the primary diagnosis is in the diagnoses table with a certain ICD9 code. But the user's current question doesn't mention an ICD9 code, just the name. Alternatively, perhaps "upper gi bleed" is a SHORT_TITLE in the diagnoses table. So we need to join demographic and diagnoses on HADM_ID, filter where SHORT_TITLE = 'upper gi bleed', and then check the DOB_YEAR in demographic. But the user's question specifies "primary disease", which might imply that it's the main diagnosis. If the main diagnosis is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, then we don't need to join. But if it's in diagnoses, then we do. This is a bit of a dilemma. The schema doesn't clearly indicate where the primary diagnosis is stored. However, given that the example in the job description uses the diagnoses table for a diagnosis query (ICD9 code), perhaps the standard approach is to use the diagnoses table for diagnosis-related queries, even if it's the primary one. But the presence of the DIAGNOSIS column in demographic complicates this. Alternatively, maybe the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is a textual description, and the coded diagnoses (ICD9) are in the diagnoses table. So if the user refers to a diagnosis by name (like "upper gi bleed"), it's possible that this is a SHORT_TITLE in the

QUESTION: Find the number of patients admitted before 2138 who had unspecified schizophrenia and unspecified diagnoses.

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."ADMITYEAR" < "2138" AND DIAGNOSES."LONG_TITLE" = "Unspecified schizophrenia, unspecified"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the number of patients admitted before 2138 who had unspecified schizophrenia and unspecified diagnoses. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The demographic table has patient admissions and their details, including ADMITYEAR. The diagnoses table contains the medical conditions, specifically looking for "unspecified schizophrenia" and "unspecified diagnoses". The user mentioned "unspecified schizophrenia" and "unspecified diagnoses", so I should check the SHORT_TITLE in the diagnoses table. The example shows that SHORT_TITLE is used for exact matches. So, I'll look for DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = 'unspecified schizophrenia' and another condition for 'unspecified diagnoses'. Wait, but the user says "and unspecified diagnoses"—maybe that's a separate condition. Or perhaps "unspecified schizophrenia" is one diagnosis and "unspecified diagnoses" is another. Wait, maybe "unspecified diagnoses" is a separate ICD9 code. Hmm, but the question says "unspecified schizophrenia and unspecified diagnoses"—maybe they mean two different conditions. But how to represent that? Wait, the example in the data_preview shows that DIAGNOSES has entries like "CHF NOS" with SHORT_TITLE. So "unspecified schizophrenia" would be a SHORT_TITLE, and "unspecified diagnoses" might be another SHORT_TITLE. But I need to make sure that both conditions are met for the same patient. So the patient must have both diagnoses: one for unspecified schizophrenia and another for unspecified diagnoses. Or maybe "unspecified diagnoses" is a different way, but perhaps the user means any unspecified diagnosis along with schizophrenia. Wait, the question says "had unspecified schizophrenia and unspecified diagnoses"—so two separate conditions. So the patient must have at least one diagnosis of unspecified schizophrenia and at least one diagnosis of unspecified diagnoses. But how to structure that in SQL. So, we need to join the demographic table with the diagnoses table twice: once for the schizophrenia and once for the unspecified diagnoses. Alternatively, use a subquery or INTERSECT. But since SQLite doesn't support INTERSECT with multiple conditions easily, perhaps a better approach is to join the diagnoses table twice. Let me think. Alternatively, we can use EXISTS clauses. For each patient in demographic, check if they have a diagnosis of 'unspecified schizophrenia' and another diagnosis of 'unspecified diagnoses'. But how to ensure both exist for the same SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID? Wait, the HADM_ID is per admission. So each admission (HADM_ID) is linked to a SUBJECT_ID. So the patient could have multiple admissions. The user says "admitted before 2138", which refers to ADMITYEAR in demographic. So we need to find patients (SUBJECT_ID) who had an admission before 2138 (ADMITYEAR < 2138) and during that admission (HADM_ID) had both 'unspecified schizophrenia' and 'unspecified diagnoses' diagnoses. Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Are the diagnoses from the same admission or any admission? The user says "patients admitted before 2138 who had...", so likely the diagnoses are from the same admission that was before 2138. So the HADM_ID in demographic is linked to the diagnoses in that admission. So the approach would be: 1. Select from demographic where ADMITYEAR < 2138. 2. Join with diagnoses on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID to find those with 'unspecified schizophrenia'. 3. Also join again with diagnoses to find those with 'unspecified diagnoses' in the same HADM_ID. 4. Count distinct SUBJECT_ID from demographic. Wait, but joining the same table twice might be necessary. Let's structure the query as: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT demographic.SUBJECT_ID) FROM demographic INNER JOIN diagnoses d1 ON demographic.HADM_ID = d1.HADM_ID AND demographic.SUBJECT_ID = d1.SUBJECT_ID INNER JOIN diagnoses d2 ON demographic.HADM_ID = d2.HADM_ID AND demographic.SUBJECT_ID = d2.SUBJECT_ID WHERE demographic.ADMITYEAR < 2138 AND d1.SHORT_TITLE = 'unspecified schizophrenia' AND d2.SHORT_TITLE = 'unspecified diagnoses'; But the user's example uses the table name in quotes, like DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE". Also, the instructions say to prefix columns with TABLE_NAME and wrap in quotes. So in the query, we need to use diagnoses."SHORT_TITLE". Wait, but in the example, the user's output was: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" So the table names are in uppercase, and columns are quoted with table names. So perhaps the correct way is to use uppercase table names and quote the columns. But the actual table names in the schema are lowercase, like "demographic" and "diagnoses". Wait, the schema shows that the tables are created with quotes, e.g., CREATE TABLE "demographic" (...). So in SQLite, the table names are case-insensitive but stored as given. However, in the example, the user's output uses DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES in uppercase. But the actual table names in the schema are in lowercase. Wait, looking back at the schema: CREATE TABLE "demographic" (...) CREATE TABLE "diagnoses" (...) So the actual table names are "demographic" and "diagnoses", but in the example, the user's output uses DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES. However, SQLite is case-insensitive for table names. So perhaps it's acceptable to use uppercase for the table names in the query. But to be safe, perhaps use the exact case as in the schema. Wait, the schema shows that the tables are created with lowercase names in quotes, like "demographic". So in SQLite, the table name is stored as "demographic", but you can refer to it as DEMOGRAPHIC, demographic, etc. But the example uses DEMOGRAPHIC, so perhaps the user expects uppercase. But the instructions say to return SQL with no comments, and to use the table names as given. Wait, the example uses DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES in uppercase, but the actual schema has them in lowercase. Hmm, maybe the example is just an example, and the actual tables are as per the schema. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the exact table names as in the schema, which are "demographic" and "diagnoses". Wait, but the example in the job description shows: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" But in the schema, the tables are "demographic" and "diagnoses". So perhaps the example is using uppercase, but the actual tables are lowercase. That might be a mistake, but perhaps the user expects to use uppercase as per the example. Alternatively, maybe the table names in the database are actually uppercase. But according to the schema provided, the tables are created with lowercase names in quotes. So in SQLite, the table names are case-insensitive, but the quotes make them case-sensitive. Wait, no—SQLite's table names are case-insensitive unless enclosed in double quotes. Wait, no: in SQLite, the table names are stored as given, but the queries are case-insensitive. For example, if you create a table as "MyTable", you can refer to it as mytable, MYTABLE, etc. But if the name was created with quotes and has specific case, you need to use the exact case when using quotes. So perhaps in the actual database, the tables are named with uppercase, but according to the schema provided, they are lowercase. This is a bit confusing. But given the example uses DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES in uppercase, perhaps the correct approach is to follow that example. So in the query, use DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES in uppercase, and quote the column names with the table names in uppercase as well. But the actual schema has the tables as "demographic" and "diagnoses". So perhaps the correct table names are lowercase. But the example uses uppercase. This is conflicting. However, the user's instruction says to assume SQLite and to use the exact table and column names as given. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the exact table names as per the schema, which are "demographic" and "diagnoses", in lowercase. But the example uses uppercase. Hmm. This is a bit of a problem. But given that the example uses uppercase, perhaps the user expects that, even if the schema shows lowercase. Maybe the schema's CREATE TABLE statements use quotes but the actual table names are in uppercase. Alternatively, it's a mistake in the schema. But given the example, I'll proceed with uppercase table names as in the example. So, proceeding with DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES in uppercase. Now, the user wants patients admitted before 2138 (ADMITYEAR < 2138) who had both 'unspecified schizophrenia' and 'unspecified diagnoses'. So each patient must have at least two diagnoses: one with SHORT_TITLE 'unspecified schizophrenia' and another with SHORT_TITLE 'unspecified

QUESTION: provide the minimum age of patients primarily diagnosed for hypoxia and expired before the year 2155.

TRUE: SELECT MIN ( DEMOGRAPHIC."AGE" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS" = "HYPOXIA" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."DOD_YEAR" < "2155.0"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants the minimum age of patients who were primarily diagnosed with hypoxia and expired before 2155. First, I need to identify the primary diagnosis. The demographic table has a DIAGNOSIS column, which might be the primary one. Hypoxia could be in there. But wait, the diagnoses table has SHORT_TITLE. The user mentioned that when asked to use diagnoses, we should search SHORT_TITLE exactly. However, the question says "primarily diagnosed," which might refer to the DIAGNOSIS field in demographic. Hmm, need to check the schema. Looking at the schema, the demographic table has DIAGNOSIS as a text field. So maybe the primary diagnosis is there. But the diagnoses table has more detailed entries. Wait, the data preview shows DIAGNOSIS in demographic as "SEPSIS" for some entries. So perhaps the primary diagnosis is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, and other diagnoses are in the diagnoses table. The user's question says "primarily diagnosed," so probably using demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But wait, the example given earlier uses the diagnoses table for ICD9 codes. The user instruction says when asked about diagnoses, use the diagnoses table. But the example for "hypoxia" might be in the DIAGNOSIS field. Wait, the example in the data preview for DIAGNOSES has "Congestive heart failure" as a SHORT_TITLE. So if the user is asking for hypoxia, maybe it's in the SHORT_TITLE of diagnoses. But the question specifies "primarily diagnosed," which might mean the main diagnosis in demographic. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the data_preview again. In the demographic table, DIAGNOSIS is "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B", etc. So perhaps the primary diagnosis is there, and the diagnoses table includes secondary diagnoses. But the user's instruction says when asked about diagnoses, use the diagnoses table. Wait, the schema comment says: "diagnoses: use this table when asked about diagnoses on patients, like what patients had cancer". So if the question is about a diagnosis, use the diagnoses table. But the term "primarily diagnosed" might refer to the primary diagnosis in the demographic table. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe "primarily" here means the main condition they were admitted for, which is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. But the example given in the job description uses the diagnoses table for ICD9 codes. For instance, the example query joins demographic with diagnoses on HADM_ID and filters on DIAGNOSES.ICD9_CODE. So perhaps even for primary diagnoses, they are in the diagnoses table. But how to determine which one is primary? Maybe the first or the one with a certain flag? The schema doesn't indicate a primary flag in diagnoses. So perhaps the primary diagnosis is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, and the others are in diagnoses. But the user's instruction says to use the diagnoses table when asked about diagnoses. The question here is about patients primarily diagnosed with hypoxia. So maybe hypoxia is a SHORT_TITLE in diagnoses. But how to link that to being the primary diagnosis? Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is the one listed in demographic.DIAGNOSIS. So if the DIAGNOSIS field in demographic contains 'hypoxia', then those are the primary cases. But the data preview shows DIAGNOSIS as "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B", etc. So perhaps the primary diagnosis is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, and other secondary diagnoses are in the diagnoses table. Therefore, to find patients primarily diagnosed with hypoxia, we need to look at demographic.DIAGNOSIS = 'hypoxia'. However, the user might be referring to the diagnoses table's SHORT_TITLE. This is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe "primarily diagnosed" refers to the principal diagnosis, which could be in the diagnoses table with a certain ICD9 code. But without a flag, it's hard to tell. The example given in the data_preview for diagnoses has two entries for the same HADM_ID, so multiple diagnoses per admission. So perhaps the primary is the one in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, and others are secondary. Given that, the user's question would require joining demographic and diagnoses tables. Wait, but the question is about patients who expired before 2155. The demographic table has EXPIRE_FLAG (1 if expired) and DOD_YEAR. So we need to check if EXPIRE_FLAG is 1 and DOD_YEAR < 2155. So putting it all together: We need to find patients where their primary diagnosis (demographic.DIAGNOSIS) is hypoxia, and they expired (EXPIRE_FLAG = 1) before 2155 (DOD_YEAR < 2155). Then get the minimum age from those patients. Wait, but the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is a text field. So we need to check if it's exactly 'hypoxia'. But maybe it's case-insensitive? The example in the data_preview has "SEPSIS" in uppercase. So perhaps we should use LOWER(demographic.DIAGNOSIS) = 'hypoxia' to match regardless of case. But the user instruction says when using diagnoses (the table), to match SHORT_TITLE exactly. But here, if we're using demographic.DIAGNOSIS, maybe we should also do a case-insensitive match. So LOWER(demographic.DIAGNOSIS) = 'hypoxia'. Alternatively, maybe the DIAGNOSIS in demographic is already in a specific format. But to be safe, using LOWER would handle variations. So the steps are: 1. Select from demographic where DIAGNOSIS (lowercase) is 'hypoxia'. 2. And EXPIRE_FLAG is 1 (expired). 3. And DOD_YEAR < 2155. 4. Then find the minimum AGE among these patients. But wait, the AGE field in demographic is the patient's age at admission. Is that correct? The schema says AGE is an integer. So assuming that's correct. So the SQL would be: SELECT MIN(demographic.AGE) FROM demographic WHERE LOWER(demographic.DIAGNOSIS) = 'hypoxia' AND demographic.EXPIRE_FLAG = 1 AND demographic.DOD_YEAR < 2155; But wait, the user mentioned "primarily diagnosed for hypoxia". If the primary diagnosis is in demographic.DIAGNOSIS, then this approach works. If it's in the diagnoses table's SHORT_TITLE, then we need to join with diagnoses and check there. But the example given in the data_preview for diagnoses has SHORT_TITLE like "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". So if hypoxia is a SHORT_TITLE in diagnoses, then we need to join on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID between demographic and diagnoses, filter where diagnoses.SHORT_TITLE = 'hypoxia', and then check the expire conditions. But the question says "primarily diagnosed", which might imply that hypoxia is the primary diagnosis, which could be in the demographic.DIAGNOSIS. However, the example in the job description uses the diagnoses table for the ICD9 code. So perhaps the correct approach is to join demographic with diagnoses on HADM_ID and look for SHORT_TITLE = 'hypoxia' in diagnoses, and then apply the expire conditions. But the user's instruction says when asked about diagnoses, use the diagnoses table. So in this case, since the question is about a diagnosis (hypoxia), we should use the diagnoses table. But the term "primarily" might indicate that it's the primary diagnosis, which could be in the demographic.DIAGNOSIS. This is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps "primarily diagnosed" refers to the principal diagnosis, which is in the demographic.DIAGNOSIS. For example, in the data_preview, the DIAGNOSIS is "SEPSIS", which might be the primary reason for admission. So if the user is asking for patients primarily diagnosed with hypoxia, we should look at demographic.DIAGNOSIS = 'hypoxia' (case-insensitive), and then check the expire conditions. But how do we know if 'hypoxia' is the correct term in demographic.DIAGNOSIS? The data_preview shows entries like "SEPSIS" and "HEPATITIS B". So perhaps the DIAGNOSIS field uses those terms. If the user's question is about hypoxia, we need to match that exactly in the DIAGNOSIS field. Alternatively, maybe the primary diagnosis is also recorded in the diagnoses table with a specific ICD9 code. But without knowing the exact ICD9 code for hypoxia, it's hard to map. The user might expect to use the SHORT_TITLE in diagnoses for 'hypoxia'. This is a bit ambiguous. Let's re-examine the user's question: "provide the minimum age of patients primarily diagnosed for hypoxia and expired before the year 2155." The key points are: - primarily diagnosed for hypoxia: so the main diagnosis is hypoxia. - expired before 2155: EXPIRE_FLAG = 1 and DOD_YEAR < 2155. Assuming that 'primarily diagnosed' refers to the DIAGNOSIS field in demographic, then the query would filter on demographic.DIAGNOSIS = 'hypoxia' (case-insensitive). But if it's in the diagnoses table, then we need to join and filter on SHORT_TITLE. But the example in the data_preview for diagnoses has SHORT_TITLEs like "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS".

QUESTION: how many patients are diagnosed with primary disease acidosis and are below 79 years of age?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."DIAGNOSIS" = "ACIDOSIS" AND DEMOGRAPHIC."AGE" < "79"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants to know how many patients are diagnosed with "primary disease acidosis" and are under 79 years old. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The diagnosis information is in the DIAGNOSES table, and patient demographics like age are in the DEMOGRAPHIC table. So, I'll need to join these two tables on HADM_ID since that's the common key. The user mentioned "primary disease acidosis". Looking at the schema, the DIAGNOSES table has a SHORT_TITLE column. The example provided uses exact matches, so I should check for SHORT_TITLE = 'acidosis'. But wait, the question says "primary disease", but the example data shows that DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE entries are specific like "Hyposmolality" or "CHF NOS". Maybe "acidosis" is the exact term here. So the condition would be DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = 'acidosis'. Next, the age condition. The DEMOGRAPHIC table has an AGE column. The user wants patients below 79, so AGE < 79. But I should check if AGE is stored as an integer, which it is according to the schema. So that's straightforward. Now, to count distinct patients. Since each patient has a SUBJECT_ID in DEMOGRAPHIC, I should count distinct DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID to avoid duplicates from multiple admissions or diagnoses. Putting it all together: join DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID, filter where SHORT_TITLE is 'acidosis' and AGE < 79, then count the distinct SUBJECT_IDs. Wait, but in the example given earlier, the user asked for "ICD9 9951" and the query used DIAGNOSES.ICD9_CODE. But here, the user is asking about the diagnosis name, so using SHORT_TITLE makes sense. The data preview shows that SHORT_TITLE entries are like "Hyposmolality", so exact match is needed. Also, the user mentioned "primary disease", but the schema doesn't have a field indicating if a diagnosis is primary. Maybe that's a red herring, or perhaps the DIAGNOSIS column in DEMOGRAPHIC is the primary one. Wait, the DEMOGRAPHIC table has a DIAGNOSIS column which is the primary diagnosis. So perhaps the correct approach is to join DEMOGRAPHIC's DIAGNOSIS with DIAGNOSES' SHORT_TITLE? Or maybe the primary diagnosis is in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS, and other diagnoses are in DIAGNOSES. Wait, looking at the schema comments: "demographic - info on patient, when counting patients count by demographic.subject_id" and "diagnoses: use this table when asked about diagnoses on patients, like what patients had cancer". The DIAGNOSES table contains all diagnoses, while DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS is the primary diagnosis. But the user's question is about being diagnosed with acidosis as a primary disease. So maybe the primary diagnosis is in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. Let me check the data preview. In the DEMOGRAPHIC data preview, the DIAGNOSIS column has values like "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B", etc. So if the primary diagnosis is there, then the condition would be on DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. But the user's question says "diagnosed with primary disease acidosis", which might imply that acidosis is the primary diagnosis. However, the example given in the data_preview for DIAGNOSES includes "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS" as SHORT_TITLEs. So if "acidosis" is a SHORT_TITLE in DIAGNOSES, then the user might be referring to any diagnosis of acidosis, not necessarily the primary one. But the question specifies "primary disease", so perhaps the primary diagnosis is in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. This is a bit ambiguous. The schema comment for DEMOGRAPHIC says DIAGNOSIS is a column, but the DIAGNOSES table is for all diagnoses. The example given in the data_preview for DIAGNOSES shows multiple entries per HADM_ID, indicating that DIAGNOSES contains all diagnoses, while DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS is the primary one. So, if the user wants patients whose primary diagnosis is acidosis, then we should check DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS = 'acidosis'. But if they have any diagnosis of acidosis (primary or secondary), then we use DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = 'acidosis'. The question says "diagnosed with primary disease acidosis", which suggests that acidosis is the primary diagnosis. Therefore, we should filter DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS = 'acidosis' and also check DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = 'acidosis'? Or is the primary diagnosis stored in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS? Looking at the data_preview for DEMOGRAPHIC, the DIAGNOSIS column has entries like "SEPSIS", "HEPATITIS B", etc. So if the primary diagnosis is there, then the condition would be on that column. However, the user's question might be using "primary disease" to mean the main condition, but the actual data might not have that distinction clear. Alternatively, perhaps the DIAGNOSES table includes all diagnoses, including the primary one, and the primary is indicated somehow else, but the schema doesn't mention that. Given the ambiguity, but the example provided in the data_preview for DIAGNOSES includes multiple diagnoses per HADM_ID, it's possible that the primary diagnosis is in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. Therefore, to find patients with primary disease acidosis, we should filter DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS = 'acidosis'. However, the user might have intended to use the DIAGNOSES table, as in the example where the query joins DIAGNOSES for the ICD9 code. Wait, the example given earlier was: User: Find all patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951 Output SQL joins DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID and checks DIAGNOSES.ICD9_CODE = "9951" So in that case, the diagnosis is looked up in DIAGNOSES, not in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. Therefore, perhaps the DIAGNOSES table is the correct one to use for any diagnosis, regardless of whether it's primary or not. The DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS might be the primary, but the user's question might not be specific about that. However, the user's question says "diagnosed with primary disease acidosis", which implies that acidosis is the primary diagnosis. So if the primary diagnosis is in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS, then we need to check that. But if the primary is in DIAGNOSES with some flag, which isn't present in the schema, then we can't. Given that the schema doesn't have a column indicating whether a diagnosis in DIAGNOSES is primary, and the example uses DIAGNOSES for the diagnosis, perhaps the user intended to use the DIAGNOSES table. However, the mention of "primary disease" complicates things. Since the schema doesn't provide a way to determine primary vs secondary in DIAGNOSES, maybe the user is using "primary disease" as part of the term, like "primary acidosis", but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps "primary disease acidosis" is a way of saying the main diagnosis is acidosis, which would be in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS. But in the data_preview, the DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS has entries like "SEPSIS", so if a patient's primary diagnosis is acidosis, that's where it would be. Therefore, the correct approach would be to filter DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS = 'acidosis' and join with DIAGNOSES if necessary. Wait, but the user might be referring to any diagnosis of acidosis, not necessarily the primary one. The example given in the data_preview for DIAGNOSES includes "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS" as SHORT_TITLEs, so if "acidosis" is a SHORT_TITLE, then the query should use DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = 'acidosis'. But the user mentioned "primary disease", which might be a red herring, or perhaps they meant the main diagnosis. Since the schema doesn't clarify, but the example uses DIAGNOSES for the diagnosis code, I'll proceed with using DIAGNOSES.SHORT_TITLE = 'acidosis' and join with DEMOGRAPHIC on HADM_ID, then filter by AGE < 79. So the SQL would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID") FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES ON DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."SHORT_TITLE" = 'acidosis' AND DEMOGRAPHIC."AGE" < 79 But wait, the user said "primary disease acidosis", which might imply that it's the primary diagnosis. If the primary diagnosis is in DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS, then the condition should be DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS = 'acidosis'. However, in the data_preview, the DEMOGRAPHIC.DIAGNOSIS has entries like "SEPSIS", so if a patient's primary

QUESTION: how many patients have the drug code pant40i?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PRESCRIPTIONS on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PRESCRIPTIONS.HADM_ID WHERE PRESCRIPTIONS."FORMULARY_DRUG_CD" = "PANT40I"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user is asking how many patients have the drug code 'pant40i'. First, I need to figure out which table contains drug codes. Looking at the schema, the prescriptions table has a column called FORMULARY_DRUG_CD, which probably stands for formulary drug code. That's where the drug code would be. Next, the question is about counting patients. The demographic table's SUBJECT_ID is the primary key for patients, so I should count distinct SUBJECT_ID from there. But since the drug code is in prescriptions, I need to join the two tables on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID to ensure we're linking the correct patient admissions. Wait, do I need to join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID? The prescriptions table has both, and demographic also has HADM_ID. Since each HADM_ID is tied to a specific admission, joining on both would ensure we're matching the correct patient's admission with their prescriptions. That makes sense. Now, the WHERE clause should filter where FORMULARY_DRUG_CD equals 'pant40i'. But the example shows using quotes around the value, like "9951". However, in SQLite, string literals should use single quotes. Wait, the example used double quotes, but maybe that's how it's stored. Let me check the data preview. In prescriptions, the FORMULARY_DRUG_CD has values like "PNEU25I", "BISA5", etc., so the actual codes are in uppercase. But the user is asking for 'pant40i', which is lowercase. Should I use LOWER() to make it case-insensitive? The example didn't do that, but the user might not know the exact case. However, the job description says when matching strings, use LOWER(). Wait, the example given in the job description uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" without LOWER, but the user instruction says to use LOWER() when matching strings. Hmm, there's a conflict here. Wait, the job description's example shows matching without LOWER, but the instruction says: "When matching string match them lowercase LOWER()". So maybe the correct approach is to use LOWER(FORMULARY_DRUG_CD) = 'pant40i'? But the example in the job description didn't do that. Let me check the example again. The example query was for ICD9_CODE 9951, which is a number, so maybe that's why they didn't use LOWER. But for text fields, the instruction says to use LOWER. So in this case, since FORMULARY_DRUG_CD is a text field, we should use LOWER to make the comparison case-insensitive. But the user wrote 'pant40i' in lowercase, so the code in the database might be stored in uppercase, like 'PANT40I'. Therefore, converting both to lowercase would match correctly. So the WHERE clause should be LOWER(prescriptions.FORMULARY_DRUG_CD) = 'pant40i'. But wait, the user's question is about the drug code 'pant40i', which is the exact code. However, if the database stores it in uppercase, then the comparison would fail unless we use LOWER. Alternatively, maybe the code is stored exactly as 'pant40i', but that's less likely. To be safe, following the instruction to use LOWER() when matching strings is better. But looking back at the data preview for prescriptions, the FORMULARY_DRUG_CD values are like "PNEU25I", "BISA5", etc., which are uppercase. So the user's input 'pant40i' would not match unless we convert both to lowercase. Therefore, the correct condition would be LOWER(prescriptions.FORMULARY_DRUG_CD) = LOWER('pant40i'). But since the user provided 'pant40i' in lowercase, maybe just LOWER(prescriptions.FORMULARY_DRUG_CD) = 'pant40i' would suffice. Alternatively, using = 'PANT40I' without LOWER if the code is stored in uppercase. But the instruction says to use LOWER(), so I should follow that. Wait, the job description's example for diagnoses uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", which is a numeric code, so no LOWER needed. But for text fields like SHORT_TITLE, the instruction says to use LOWER. So in this case, since FORMULARY_DRUG_CD is a text field, we should use LOWER. Putting it all together: select count distinct demographic.subject_id from demographic joined with prescriptions on subject_id and hadm_id, where lower(formulary_drug_cd) = 'pant40i'. But wait, the example in the job description used quotes around the value, like "9951", but in SQLite, string literals should be in single quotes. However, the example used double quotes, which might be acceptable in SQLite, but it's better to use single quotes. But the user's instruction says to return the SQL as per the example, which used double quotes. Hmm, conflicting. Wait, the example output was: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" Here, the value "9951" is in double quotes, but in SQL, string literals should be in single quotes. However, since ICD9_CODE is a TEXT field, maybe the example is incorrect. But the user's instruction says to follow the example. So perhaps in this case, the correct approach is to use double quotes around the value, even though it's a string. Alternatively, maybe the ICD9_CODE is stored as text but the value is numeric. But in the data preview, ICD9_CODE is in quotes, like "2761", so it's stored as text. Therefore, the correct comparison should be with quotes. But in SQL, string literals should be in single quotes. However, SQLite allows double quotes for string literals, but it's not standard. However, the example uses double quotes, so perhaps the user expects that. But the job description says to assume SQLite, which does allow double quotes for string literals, though it's not recommended. However, to follow the example, I'll use double quotes. Wait, but the user's instruction says to return the SQL with no comments and exactly as per the example. So in the example, the WHERE clause uses DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951", which is comparing a text column to a number in double quotes. But in reality, since ICD9_CODE is TEXT, the value should be a string. So perhaps the correct way is to use single quotes. But the example uses double quotes. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow it. Let me check the data preview for diagnoses. In the data preview, ICD9_CODE is in quotes, like "2761", which implies it's stored as a string. So the correct comparison would be WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = '2761', using single quotes. But the example uses double quotes. Hmm. Maybe in SQLite, double quotes are used for identifiers, and single quotes for strings. So the example is actually incorrect. But the user provided that example, so perhaps we should follow the same style, even if it's technically wrong. But that's risky. Alternatively, perhaps the example is using double quotes around the value because in the data, the ICD9_CODE is stored as a string without quotes, but that's not possible. Wait, in the data preview, the ICD9_CODE is shown with double quotes, which might be just the CSV formatting. So in reality, the actual value is 2761 as a string. So in SQL, to compare, we should use single quotes. But the example uses double quotes, which in SQLite would be treated as a string literal if the setting is set to accept double quotes, but it's not standard. This is a bit of a dilemma. The job description says to assume SQLite and be careful with functions. So perhaps the correct approach is to use single quotes for string literals. However, the example provided by the user uses double quotes. To adhere to the example, maybe we should use double quotes. But that's technically incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example, and we should use single quotes. But the user's instruction says to follow the example strictly. So in the example, the WHERE clause uses "9951" with double quotes. So for consistency, even though it's not correct SQL, we should use double quotes here as well. Therefore, the condition would be WHERE prescriptions."FORMULARY_DRUG_CD" = "pant40i". But since the data preview shows that FORMULARY_DRUG_CD is stored in uppercase (e.g., "PNEU25I"), the comparison would fail unless we use LOWER. So the correct condition would be LOWER(prescriptions."FORMULARY_DRUG_CD") = "pant40i". But the example didn't use LOWER for the ICD9_CODE, which was a numeric string. So perhaps for text fields, we need to use LOWER as per the instruction. Wait, the job description explicitly says: "When matching string match them

CASE: 823634609ee30ffe023353e3f58c68ad
QUESTION: how many patients are diagnosed with the history of tobacco use and tested under the lab category blood gas?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID INNER JOIN LAB on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = LAB.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."SHORT_TITLE" = "History of tobacco use" AND LAB."CATEGORY" = "Blood Gas"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants to know how many patients are diagnosed with a history of tobacco use and have had a lab test in the blood gas category. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. Diagnoses are in the DIAGNOSES table, and lab tests are in the LAB table. The patient count should be based on DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID since each subject is a unique patient. The user mentioned "diagnosed with the history of tobacco use." Looking at the DIAGNOSES table, the SHORT_TITLE is where the diagnosis name is stored. So I should check where SHORT_TITLE equals 'Tobacco use' exactly. Wait, the example given in the data preview uses exact terms, like "Hyposmolality" and "CHF NOS". So the query should use an exact match on SHORT_TITLE for 'Tobacco use'. Next, the lab category is 'Blood Gas'. In the LAB table, there's a CATEGORY column. So I need to filter LAB where CATEGORY is 'Blood Gas'. To count distinct patients, I need to join DEMOGRAPHIC with DIAGNOSES and LAB. Since both DIAGNOSES and LAB have HADM_ID, I can join DEMOGRAPHIC to DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID, and similarly join DEMOGRAPHIC to LAB on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. But wait, maybe it's better to join DIAGNOSES and LAB through DEMOGRAPHIC's HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. Alternatively, use inner joins between DEMOGRAPHIC, DIAGNOSES, and LAB, ensuring that the same patient has both the diagnosis and the lab test. So the structure would be: select count distinct demographic.subject_id from demographic, join diagnoses on demographic.hadm_id and subject_id, and join lab on demographic.hadm_id and subject_id, where diagnoses.short_title is 'Tobacco use' and lab.category is 'Blood Gas'. Wait, but in the schema, DIAGNOSES and LAB both have HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. So the joins should be on both HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID to ensure it's the same admission and patient. But in the example given earlier, the join was on HADM_ID only. Let me check the example: the example joined DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID. But in the schema, both tables have HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. However, in the data preview, for example, DIAGNOSES has SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. So perhaps each HADM_ID is linked to a SUBJECT_ID in DEMOGRAPHIC. So joining DEMOGRAPHIC to DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID would be more accurate. Wait, but in the example provided earlier, the join was only on HADM_ID. Let me check the example again. In the example, the user asked for patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951, and the SQL was: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DIAGNOSES."ICD9_CODE" = "9951" So the example joins on HADM_ID only. That suggests that HADM_ID is sufficient to link the tables. But in reality, each HADM_ID is unique to a patient's admission, so each HADM_ID in DEMOGRAPHIC corresponds to one admission. However, a patient can have multiple admissions (HADM_IDs). But in this case, the count is for distinct SUBJECT_IDs, so even if a patient had multiple admissions with the diagnosis and lab, they would be counted once. So, for the current query, the approach is to join DEMOGRAPHIC with DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID, and join DEMOGRAPHIC with LAB on HADM_ID as well. Wait, but LAB also has HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. So perhaps joining DEMOGRAPHIC to DIAGNOSES on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID, and DEMOGRAPHIC to LAB on HADM_ID and SUBJECT_ID. But the example only used HADM_ID. Maybe the HADM_ID is sufficient because each HADM_ID is linked to a specific admission for a patient. So, in the DEMOGRAPHIC table, each row represents a unique admission (HADM_ID) for a patient (SUBJECT_ID). Therefore, joining on HADM_ID would link the demographic info to the diagnoses and lab tests for that specific admission. But the user is asking for patients who have both a diagnosis of tobacco use (in any admission) and a lab test in blood gas (in any admission). Wait, or is it the same admission? The question isn't clear. The user says "diagnosed with the history of tobacco use and tested under the lab category blood gas". It could be that the diagnosis and lab test are from the same admission or different ones. But since the question doesn't specify, we might need to assume that they can be from different admissions. However, joining on HADM_ID would restrict to the same admission. But if the user wants any occurrence of both, regardless of admission, then we need to find patients who have at least one diagnosis of tobacco use in any admission and at least one lab test in blood gas in any admission. In that case, the joins should be on SUBJECT_ID, not HADM_ID. Because a patient (SUBJECT_ID) can have multiple HADM_IDs. So, to find patients who have at least one diagnosis of tobacco use (in any of their admissions) and at least one lab test in blood gas (in any of their admissions), we need to join DIAGNOSES and LAB on SUBJECT_ID, not HADM_ID. Wait, but how to structure the query. Let's think: we need to find all SUBJECT_IDs from DIAGNOSES where SHORT_TITLE is 'Tobacco use', and all SUBJECT_IDs from LAB where CATEGORY is 'Blood Gas', then find the intersection of these SUBJECT_IDs, and count the distinct ones. So, perhaps using INNER JOIN between DIAGNOSES and LAB on SUBJECT_ID, but that might not be correct because a patient could have a diagnosis in one admission and a lab test in another. So the correct approach is to find SUBJECT_IDs that exist in both DIAGNOSES (with the diagnosis) and LAB (with the lab category), then count the distinct ones in DEMOGRAPHIC. Alternatively, use EXISTS clauses. For example: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT D.SUBJECT_ID) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC D WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM DIAGNOSES DIAG WHERE DIAG.SUBJECT_ID = D.SUBJECT_ID AND DIAG.SHORT_TITLE = 'Tobacco use' ) AND EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM LAB L WHERE L.SUBJECT_ID = D.SUBJECT_ID AND L.CATEGORY = 'Blood Gas' ); This would count patients who have at least one diagnosis of tobacco use in any admission and at least one lab test in blood gas in any admission. This approach uses EXISTS subqueries, which might be more efficient and accurate for this case. But the example provided earlier used a JOIN approach. The user's example for "Find all patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951" used a JOIN on HADM_ID. However, in that case, it's per admission. But the current question doesn't specify that the diagnosis and lab test are from the same admission, so the correct approach is to check for the existence of both conditions in the patient's history, regardless of admission. Therefore, using EXISTS clauses would be more appropriate here. However, the user's example used a JOIN, and the instructions say to prefer simple solutions. So maybe the user expects a JOIN approach, but that might not be accurate if the diagnosis and lab are from different admissions. Alternatively, perhaps the lab tests and diagnoses are linked by HADM_ID, meaning they occurred during the same admission. But the question doesn't specify that. The user's question is ambiguous. However, given the example, it's safer to follow the same approach as the example, which joined on HADM_ID. But in that example, the count was for a specific admission's diagnosis. However, the current question is about a patient's history, which could span multiple admissions. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Let's re-examine the user's question: "how many patients are diagnosed with the history of tobacco use and tested under the lab category blood gas?" The phrase "history of tobacco use" suggests that the diagnosis could be from any time in the patient's medical history, not necessarily the same admission as the lab test. Similarly, the lab test could be from any admission. Therefore, the correct approach is to find patients who have at least one diagnosis of tobacco use (any admission) and at least one lab test in blood gas (any admission), regardless of whether they occurred in the same admission. Therefore, the correct SQL would involve checking for the existence of both a diagnosis and a lab test for the same SUBJECT_ID, not necessarily the same HADM_ID. Thus, the query should select from DEMOGRAPHIC, and use EXISTS clauses to check for the presence of the diagnosis and lab test in their respective tables for the same SUBJECT_ID. But the example provided by the user used a JOIN on HADM_ID, which might imply that

QUESTION: How many patients had a lab test for sodium urine and were treated with a base drug?

TRUE: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PRESCRIPTIONS on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PRESCRIPTIONS.HADM_ID INNER JOIN LAB on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = LAB.HADM_ID WHERE PRESCRIPTIONS."DRUG_TYPE" = "MAIN" AND LAB."LABEL" = "Sodium, Urine"

LLM [deepseek-r1]: <think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL query. The user wants to know how many patients had a lab test for sodium urine and were treated with a base drug. First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The lab tests are in the LAB table, and prescriptions are in the PRESCRIPTIONS table. But since we need to count distinct patients, we'll probably need to join these tables through the DEMOGRAPHIC table or directly via SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Wait, the LAB table has SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID, same with PRESCRIPTIONS. So maybe we can join LAB and PRESCRIPTIONS on those two columns to find patients who have both a lab test and a prescription. But the lab test is for "sodium urine". Looking at the LAB table's data preview, the LABEL column has entries like "Lactate", "Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)", etc. So "sodium urine" might be in LABEL. The user might mean a lab test where LABEL is 'Sodium Urine' or similar. But the exact term is important. The data preview shows "Lactate" and "Albumin", so maybe the exact term is 'Sodium Urine'? Or perhaps 'Urine Sodium'? The question says "sodium urine", so I'll use that exact phrase in the WHERE clause, using LOWER(LAB.LABEL) = 'sodium urine' to match case-insensitively. For the prescriptions, the question mentions "base drug". The PRESCRIPTIONS table has a DRUG column. The data preview shows drugs like 'Bisacodyl'. The term "base drug" is a bit vague. Maybe it's a specific category or a drug name containing 'base'? The user might mean drugs that are bases, like sodium bicarbonate? Or perhaps 'base' is part of the drug name. Since the example in the data doesn't have such a drug, but the user's instruction says to match exact terms, I'll look for DRUG = 'base' or similar. Wait, maybe the correct term is 'Base' as a drug type? But the DRUG_TYPE in PRESCRIPTIONS is 'MAIN' in the example. Alternatively, maybe the drug's name contains 'base', but the user says "base drug", so exact match. So PRESCRIPTIONS.DRUG should be 'base'? Or perhaps the FORMULARY_DRUG_CD has 'BASE'? Not sure. The user's instruction says to use exact terms as asked. The question says "treated with a base drug", so I'll take that as the DRUG column equals 'base' or maybe 'Base'. But looking at the data preview, the drugs are things like 'Pneumococcal Vac Polyvalent', 'Bisacodyl', etc. So maybe the user intended a specific drug name, but since the example isn't present, perhaps 'base' is a typo or shorthand. Alternatively, maybe "base drug" refers to a category, but the table doesn't have a category column for prescriptions. The DRUG_TYPE in the example is 'MAIN', which might not help. Hmm. The user might have meant a drug that is a base, like sodium bicarbonate, but without knowing the exact drug names, it's hard. But according to the instructions, when the user says "base drug", we should match the exact term in the DRUG column. So I'll use LOWER(PRESCRIPTIONS.DRUG) = 'base' to find exact matches, case-insensitive. So the plan is: select distinct SUBJECT_ID from LAB where LABEL is 'sodium urine', and also have a prescription where DRUG is 'base'. Then count those distinct SUBJECT_IDs from DEMOGRAPHIC, joining LAB and PRESCRIPTIONS on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Wait, but a patient might have multiple HADM_IDs. So we need to ensure that the same SUBJECT_ID has at least one HADM_ID where both the lab test and prescription occurred. Or maybe the same HADM_ID? The question doesn't specify if it's during the same admission. The user might mean any time the patient had the lab test and was prescribed the drug, possibly in different admissions. But to be safe, perhaps joining on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID to ensure they occurred during the same hospital admission. But the question doesn't specify same admission. However, without joining on HADM_ID, it's possible that a patient had the lab test in one admission and the drug in another, which the user might still want to count. But the problem is that the HADM_ID in LAB and PRESCRIPTIONS might be different for the same SUBJECT_ID. So, to count patients who had both the lab test and the drug at any time, regardless of admission, we should join on SUBJECT_ID only. But how to ensure that there's at least one lab test and at least one prescription for the same patient. Alternatively, use EXISTS clauses. For example, select patients who exist in both the lab and prescriptions tables with the required conditions. But since the user wants a count of distinct patients, perhaps using INTERSECT would be better. But SQLite supports INTERSECT. So the SQL could be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID IN ( SELECT LAB.SUBJECT_ID FROM LAB WHERE LOWER(LAB.LABEL) = 'sodium urine' ) AND DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID IN ( SELECT PRESCRIPTIONS.SUBJECT_ID FROM PRESCRIPTIONS WHERE LOWER(PRESCRIPTIONS.DRUG) = 'base' ); But wait, the user might have intended that the lab test and prescription occurred during the same hospital admission (same HADM_ID). But the question doesn't specify that. The example given in the data preview shows that LAB and PRESCRIPTIONS can have the same HADM_ID. For example, SUBJECT_ID 10006 in LAB has HADM_ID 142345, and in DEMOGRAPHIC, that HADM_ID is associated with that SUBJECT_ID. So if the user wants patients who had both the lab test and the drug during the same admission, we need to join on both SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID. Otherwise, if it's any admission, then just SUBJECT_ID. The question is ambiguous. But since the user didn't specify same admission, perhaps the correct approach is to count patients who had at least one lab test for sodium urine and at least one prescription of a base drug, regardless of admission. So the IN approach with SUBJECT_ID only. Alternatively, using a join between LAB and PRESCRIPTIONS on SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID would require that both occurred in the same admission. But the user's question doesn't specify that. So which is correct? The example given in the job description for "Find all patients diagnosed with ICD9 9951" uses a join on HADM_ID between DEMOGRAPHIC and DIAGNOSES. But that's because each diagnosis is tied to a specific admission (HADM_ID). So in that case, the join is on HADM_ID. But for counting patients, the example uses DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC.SUBJECT_ID, which is correct because a patient can have multiple admissions. In the current question, the user is asking for patients who had both a lab test and a prescription. If the lab test and prescription can be in different admissions, then joining on SUBJECT_ID only is sufficient. But if they must be in the same admission, then join on both. But the question doesn't specify, so perhaps the intended answer is to consider that they can be in different admissions. Therefore, the correct approach is to find patients who have at least one lab test for sodium urine and at least one prescription for a base drug, regardless of when. Thus, the SQL would involve selecting SUBJECT_ID from LAB where LABEL is 'sodium urine', and SUBJECT_ID from PRESCRIPTIONS where DRUG is 'base', then finding the intersection of these two sets of SUBJECT_IDs, and counting the distinct ones in DEMOGRAPHIC. Alternatively, using INNER JOIN between LAB and PRESCRIPTIONS on SUBJECT_ID, but that would create a Cartesian product if a patient has multiple lab tests and multiple prescriptions. But since we just need to check existence, using EXISTS might be more efficient. But the simplest way is to use two subqueries with IN clauses. So the final SQL would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID") FROM DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" IN ( SELECT LAB."SUBJECT_ID" FROM LAB WHERE LOWER(LAB."LABEL") = 'sodium urine' ) AND DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" IN ( SELECT PRESCRIPTIONS."SUBJECT_ID" FROM PRESCRIPTIONS WHERE LOWER(PRESCRIPTIONS."DRUG") = 'base' ); But wait, the user might have intended that the lab test and the prescription are from the same HADM_ID. For example, during the same hospital stay. But the question doesn't specify that. Since the example in the data preview shows that LAB and PRESCRIPTIONS can share the same HADM_ID (e.g., SUBJECT_ID 10006 in LAB has HADM_ID 142345, and in DEMOGRAPHIC, that HADM_ID is present), but the prescriptions for that SUBJECT_ID might be in a different HADM_ID. If the user wants patients who had both the lab test and the
