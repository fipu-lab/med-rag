[job_description]
You are an expert SQL query analyzer specialized in identifying and categorizing errors in natural language to SQL query translations. Your task is to analyze the provided log and categorize the potential errors:

Each log consists of:

1. A unique CASE identifier
2. The original QUESTION
3. The TRUE (correct) SQL query
4. Multiple LLM-generated SQL queries, along with the corresponding models and their results

Your task is to categorize the errors in each LLM's query according to the following numbered error categories (1–5):

[error_categories]

### 1. Schema Mismatch

Errors arising from ambiguous or imprecise language that result in incorrect references to database schema elements.

- Selecting a valid column from an inappropriate table  
  Example: Using `VALUE_UNIT` from the `demographic` table instead of `lab`

- Querying non-existent columns  
  Example: Selecting `HEIGHT` from `demographic`, though the column does not exist

- Misattributing the purpose or structure of existing columns  
  Example: Interpreting free-text `DIAGNOSIS` fields as structured codes

### 2. Incorrect Aggregation Usage

Misapplication or misunderstanding of aggregation functions and grouping constructs.

- Using an inappropriate aggregation function  
  Example: Applying `COUNT` where `SUM` is intended

- Omitting `DISTINCT` when aggregation requires uniqueness  
  Example: Counting unique patients without `DISTINCT`

- Applying aggregate functions without the necessary `GROUP BY` clause

- Aggregating at an incorrect level of granularity  
  Example: Summarizing data at too coarse or too fine a level

### 3. Join Errors

Mistakes in joining relational tables, often due to missing joins, incorrect join keys, or inappropriate join types.

- Failing to include essential table joins  
  Example: Selecting diagnoses without joining to the `demographic` table

- Joining on incorrect keys  
  Example: Using `HADM_ID` instead of `SUBJECT_ID`

- Using an inappropriate join type  
  Example: Applying an `INNER JOIN` when an `OUTER JOIN` is required

### 4. Join condition misinterpretation

Misinterpretation of logical expressions within `WHERE` or `HAVING` clauses, leading to incorrect filtering or overly broad results.

- Using incorrect comparison operators  
  Example: `AGE = 65` instead of `AGE > 65`

- Omitting necessary conditions  
  Example: Failing to restrict results to abnormal lab values

- Applying incorrect logical connectors  
  Example: Using `OR` instead of `AND` when combining conditions for age

### 5. String Mismatch

Errors in string handling due to inconsistent terminology, incorrect column usage, or flawed comparison logic.

- Using inconsistent terminology  
  Example: Querying “heart attack” when the database uses “myocardial infarction”

- Selecting an inappropriate column for textual data  
  Example: Using `SHORT_TITLE` instead of `LONG_TITLE`

- Applying incorrect comparison operations  
  Example: Using `=` instead of `LIKE` for partial matches

- Ignoring input normalization (case, whitespace, etc.)  
  Example: Comparing `'SEPSIS '` to `'Sepsis'` without trimming or case handling

QUESTION: find the number of patients who are married and have been diagnosed with pyelonephritis, unspecified.

GROUND TRUTH: SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN DIAGNOSES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = DIAGNOSES.HADM_ID WHERE DEMOGRAPHIC."MARITAL_STATUS" = "MARRIED" AND DIAGNOSES."LONG_TITLE" = "Pyelonephritis, unspecified"

LLM [deepseek-v3]:

SELECT Count(DISTINCT demographic."subject_id")
FROM demographic
INNER JOIN diagnoses
ON demographic.hadm_id = diagnoses.hadm_id
WHERE demographic."marital_status" = "married"
AND diagnoses."short_title" = "pyelonephritis, unspecified"

LLM [llama3.3-70b]:

SELECT Count(DISTINCT demographic."subject_id")
FROM demographic
INNER JOIN diagnoses
ON demographic."hadm_id" = diagnoses."hadm_id"
WHERE Lower(diagnoses."short_title") = 'pyelonephritis, unspecified'
AND demographic."marital_status" = 'MARRIED'

LLM [gpt-4o]:

SELECT Count(DISTINCT demographic."subject_id")
FROM demographic
INNER JOIN diagnoses
ON demographic."hadm_id" = diagnoses."hadm_id"
WHERE Lower(demographic."marital_status") = 'married'
AND Lower(diagnoses."short_title") = 'pyelonephritis, unspecified'
